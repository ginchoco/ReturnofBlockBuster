INDY,Leave it to Ox to write a riddle in a dead language.
SPALKO,And where is it you would imagine I am from Dr. Jones?
INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL
Screenplay by David Koepp
NEVADA, 1957
M.P. (SERGEANT) *
Sorry, gentlemen, this whole areaís off
limits for weapons testing for the next
twenty-four hours, that includes all onbase personnel.
The Colonel steps out of the front passenger seat of the third *
car. Heís huge, must go two-sixty, all muscle. Heís either *
perpetually sneering or has a lipless smile, hard to tell which.
A real son-of-a-bitch, good thing heís on our side.
The MPs snap to attention. The Sergeant salutes the Colonel, but
remains firm. The Colonel walks up to the Sergeant. *
M.P. (SERGEANT) (contíd)
Iím afraid that goes for you too,
Colonel, sir. The Pentagon sent out *
revised deployment oh-dark-thirty this
a.m.
The Colonel smiles, but doesnít speak. *
The Colonel gets down on one knee. *
-- THE SOLDIERS leap out of the panel truck, silencers screwed *
onto the ends of their automatic weapons, and before we know it
theyíre BLASTING away at the outmanned and outgunned MPs,
dropping them before they get their safeties off.
The Colonel finishes tying his shoe, gets up , puts his hat back *
on and goes back to the car. *
The soldiers stash the dead bodies in the guard shack. *
The convoy drives past the checkpoint. *
SOLDIERS jump from the back of the truck. The invaders snap into *
action, silently, theyíve trained for this. Two of them slip the
helmets and armbands off the MPs and put them on themselves. *
A CROWBAR SNAPS the lock off the gate and the fence is thrown
open. With the fake MPs now standing guard at the gate, the
convoy roars through and we rise up to see --
-- beyond the rise, where thereís a huge airplane hangar and a
smaller, adjoining building. A lone airstrip leads right up to
the hangar and a set of train tracks run out of the other
building and away across the desert.
 2. 
3 EXT HANGAR 51 DAY
The convoy CRUNCHES to a stop in front of the giant main doors of
the hangar. While two INVADING SOLDIERS set about hot-wiring the
circuit box that leads to the door mechanism, the Colonel nods to
two Soldiers from the truck, *
and they go to the trunk of the sedan.
They pop it open, reach inside --
-- and pull out a prisoner, GEORGE MCHALE (îMacî to his friends),
fiftyish, sharp eyes and the easy smile of your favorite
bartender. Heís had the hell beaten out of him.
The Russian Soldiers reach into the trunk . The soldier grabs a *
fedora hat and throws it to the ground. Both soldiers haul *
another bag of bones out, SLAMMING him down on his feet next to
Mac. *
Indy gets up, grabs his hat off the floor and puts it on. *
One of the soldiers, #2 gets out of the sedan and starts to give *
orders in RUSSIAN- *
RUSSIAN 2 *
Gde INZENER. OTKPIT VOROTA. BISTRO! *
BISTRO1 BISTRO! (Whereís the engineer? *
Open the gates fast) *
Another soldier approaches. *
RUSSIAN 3 *
Za mnoy reebiata! BISTRO! Bistro! (Come *
guys, come with me faster, *
faster) DAVAYTE REEBIATA (CíMON GUYSî *
BWISTREY, BWISTREY, BWISTREY! (Letís go, *
letís go, letís go) K KAROBKYE (GET TO *
THE CIRCUIT BOX!) *
He moves to the hangar door. *
INDY *
Russians. *
 3. 
Mac squints, sizes up the heavily-armed Russians. He MUTTERS to *
Indy, with a British accent. *
MAC *
This ainít gonna be easy. *
A soldier pushes Mac next to Indy. *
INDY *
Not as easy as it used to be. *
MAC *
Weíve been through worse. *
INDY *
Oh yeah? When? *
MAC *
Flensburg. There were twice as many. *
INDY *
We were younger. *
MAC *
I still am young. *
Indy manages a smile--he likes this guy. He looks sideways, at *
one of the Russian soldiers, who has a bettered bullwhip hanging *
over the shoulder. Indyís whip. *
INDY *
(back to Mac) We had guns. *
MAC *
Details. *
INDY *
Put your hands down will ya. Youíre *
embarrassing yourself. *
MAC *
I bet you five hundred bucks we get out *
of this. *
*
*
*
 3A. 
The Russian Colonel (ANTONIN DOVCHENKO) sedan drives up and comes *
to a stop. Dovchenko steps up to them, nose to nose. Heís huge. *
MAC *
Maybe we should make that a *
hundred.(make that a hundred) (why donít *
we make that a hundred, alright) *
DOVCHENKO *
(to Indy) *
You recognize building, yes? *
Indy looks back at the building. Then turns back to Dovchenko. *
INDY *
Drop dead. *
CRACK! Dovchenko SMACKS INDY across the face and his legs go out
from under him. *
INDY (contíd)
I mean drop dead, Comrade. *
DOVCHENKO *
DEPSICUTE EEWY PYKU ZA ENUNON(Hold his *
arms behind his back) *
Dovchenko takes off his hat, hands it to one of the soldiers. He *
curls his meaty fist to CRACK him across the face again, but a *
VOICE stops him.
VOICE (O.S.)
Prasteete!
The back door of the sedan that just arrived a slender figure *
steps out, dressed as a U.S. Army soldier. DR. IRINA SPALKO is in
her mid-thirties, tall, pale, jet black hair, bangs cut straight
across. She is wearing dark glasses. She moves with a dancerís *
grace, a scabbard hanging at her side.
Dovchenko walks up to her, and salutes. *
SPALKO
Where was he found? *
DOVCHENKO
In Mexico, they were digging in the dirt. *
Looking for this junk. *
He gets Indyís satchel from the trunk of the sedan and turns it *
upside down, empties it on the hard ground. Pieces of ancient *
pottery and figurines SHATTER.
 4. 
Indy winces. That was seven weeksí work. A Spalko approaches:
INDY
Youíre not from around here. Are you? *
SPALKO
Where is it that you would imagine I am *
from, Dr. Jones?
She takes her glasses off. *
INDY
The way you sink your teeth into those
Ws, Iíd say the Eastern Ukraine.
SPALKO
Highest marks.
(she takes off her glove and *
holds out her hand)
Colonel Doctor Irina Spalko.
(Indy doesnít shake)
three times I have received Order of
Lenin, also medal of Hero of Socialist
Labor, and why? Because I know things.
I know them before anyone else, and what
I do not know, I find out. What I need
to know now --
She takes a step closer to Indy and taps a finger lightly on his
forehead.
SPALKO
-- is in here.
She moves close to him, looks deeply into his eyes. Her gaze is
intense, disquieting. He stares back at her. Sheís impressed.
SPALKO
You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
So we will try this.. Whatís the *
expression? The old-fashioned way. You *
will tell us. You will help us find what
we seek.
RUSSIAN SOLDIER *
Gatavo tovarisch palkovnik (ITíS READY, *
COMRADE COLONEL.) *
Spalko moves towards the doors. She gives the order. *
SPALKO *
Davai! (do it!) *
 5. 
A SPARK flies from the power box, a big wheel starts to turn, and
the huge hangar doors start to RUMBLE open, splitting right
between the ì5î and the ì1.î *
4 INT HANGAR 51 DAY
Hangar 51 is a massive warehouse, an endless expanse of crates
stacked to the eighty foot ceilings as far as the eye can see.
This place looks familiar to us, seems like the kind of place a
paranoid government would stash its most secret objects.
Indy and Mac are prodded inside, at the end of the Russian gun
barrels. Spalko gestures around. *
 5A. 
SPALKO *
This warehouse is where you and your
government have hidden all your secrets, *
yes? *
INDY
Iíve never been here before in my life. *
She smiles at him -- nice try, but I donít believe your act.
SPALKO
Object we seek -- rectangular storage
container. Dimensions -- two meters by
one half a meter by 66 centimeters. *
Contents of box mummified remains. This *
is no doubt familiar to you?
Suddenly Indy knows exactly what she is talking about, but he *
hesitates to volunteer anything. *
INDY
What makes you think I have any idea what
box youíre talking about?
SPALKO
Because ten years ago you were part of *
the team that examined it. *
INDY
Look even if I knew what you- *
What a sudden SSSSHHHHING!, she draws a rapier and lunges forward
in a blindingly quick fencing move, pressing the tip of the blade
against Indyís jugular.
INDY (contíd) *
Were talking about.... *
SPALKO
YOU WILL. HELP US. FIND IT!
Indy looks at her coldly.
INDY
Killing meís not gonna solve your *
problem. *
SPALKO *
ìNot gonna solve my problemî Youíre *
right. *
She BARKS to the Soldiers in Russian . *
 6. 
SPALKO (contíd) *
VAZMITYE DRUBOVA!(take the other one) *
 6A. 
Two Soldiers drag Mac across the pavement, drop him and kick him *
over in the gravel, right next to a truck. *
MAC *
Itís all gone pear shaped. *
Spalko moves forward puts on her glasses. Gives a signal. *
Indy looks on as two soldiers hold him. *
Dovchenko walks over Macís body and gets in the truck, he starts *
the engine. *
--with a ROAR, drops the truck in gear, hits the gas, and begins *
to move slowly towards Macís head, as the soldiers hold him down -- *
INDY *
Okay, okay! Hey, hey, hey! *
MAC *
He said okay for Godís sake. Are you *
going to let me up? (4F)Okay , okay, he *
said okay- would you let me up? *
 7. 
INT. HANGAR- DAY *
INDY followed by the whole group, thinks like a wild man, looking *
around. There are rectangular storage containers everywhere. *
He walks in and stops, turns to the group. *
INDY *
(mind racing)
Alright I need a compass. Compass? *
The Soldiers look at each other, confused.
INDY (contíd)
You know, north, south, east?
MAC *
West. *
INDY *
No? *
They donít seem to. Indyís eyes fall on Dovchenkoís gun.. He *
walks up to him. *
INDY (contíd) *
I need your bullets. *
Dovchenko laughs. *
DOVCHENKO *
Oh-ho-chit mai-y pa-tro-neh.(he wants my *
bullets) *
Everyone laughs. Indy walks up to Spalko in something of a rage. *
Indy turns to the woman in charge. *
INDY *
The contents of that box are highly *
magnetized. I need gunpowder. Do you *
want my help or not *
She turns, looks and -- *
 7A. 
5 MOMENTS LATER,
-- Dovchenko twists the top off one of the hand grenades dumping *
the gunpowder in Indyís left hand. *
Spalko watches him, curious and impressed. *
Indy moves towards the boxes and climbs to the top . Spalko, Mac *
and Dovchenko follow him curios. *
SPALKO *
What is the point? (V5D-donít toy with *
me Dr. Jones. What is the point of *
this?)
INDY
If itís still magnetic, the metal in *
this gunpowder should point the way. *
He reaches the top of the boxes and opens his hand, letting the *
gunpowder flies up in a cloud. In mid-air it seems to coalesce, drawn together by an unseen force, and when it lands on the floor
itís in the shape of a line, pointing down one of the aisles. *
Spalko and the group follow Indy. *
SPALKO *
Zarim! (move) *
6 PART II *
Indy with Spalko, Mac, Dovchenko and the large group of soldiers *
come around a corner of boxes into an aisle(cul-de-sac area). *
Indy gets an idea and grabs Dovchenkoís hat from his head. *
INDY *
In here. *
Two soldiers move forward and come to both sides of Indy and *
begin pouring the powder from two grenades. *
They continue to move forward. *
The group comes around another corner into the mouth of the *
aisle, itís jam-packed with crates, stacked to the ceiling. The *
soldiers pour for a second time from another two grenades. Indy *
comes to a stop following the original line, he lets the powder *
in the hat go free. *
 8. 
The group looks up as the powder as it flies up in the air and *
then comes down in a line and heads down another aisle between a *
row of boxes. Indy with the group follow the powder and turn *
into... *
Another corner. Again Pasha and the other soldier pour powder *
into the hat, but this time from four grenades, they continue *
walking. *
Indy climbs up a set of boxes and lets the powder fly free from *
the hat. *
Indy turns to the group down below, he sees the shotgun pointing *
at him. *
INDY (contíd) *
Shells, give me shotgun shells. *
He climbs down and starts to walk down the middle of the large *
aisle- *
DOVCHENKO *
Nyet, Hvatit ya emu neveru (No. Enough. *
I donít believe him. I donít trust him) *
to Spalko. *
Spalko gives the order. *
SPALKO
Give him the shells. *
Another soldier moves up next to Indy and ejects shotgun shells. *
The group follows Indy to a row of boxes. *
INDY *
Pliers. *
*
*
 8A. 
One of the soldiers hands Indy a set of pliers. The group follow *
Indy across to a large set of boxes. Indy throws the hat back to *
Dovchenko. Dovchenko catches it and puts it back on. Indy climbs *
the boxes all the way to the top, a few of the soldiers with *
their rifles follow him. Indy turns and looks at the group. *
Spalko moves closer to the boxes. Indy using the pliers opens *
the shell and pours the pellets into his hand. He dumps the *
pellets on the boxes. *
Spalko watches as the pellets roll down. She looks and sees that *
the pellets are going into the boxes. She gets more pellets and *
spreads them across the bottom of the boxes. The pellets reach *
the base of the stack of crates, roll up the side of it, and *
disappear through the crack. Spalko watches them disappear, she *
looks at Dovchenko. He gives the orders to bring down the boxes. *
DOVCHENKO *
In Russian(everybody come over. Start *
your cars-move quickly) *
Indy, pacing, watches form the top as the soldiers with Dovchenko *
begin to move the boxes down. The soldiers toss aside several *
identical oblong wooden crates. *
A group of army trucks pull into the area. *
Spalko gives orders. *
She watches as the soldiers continue to move the boxes. Mac *
mutters to himself. *
DOVCHENKO (contíd) *
ETAT (that one) TEPYE ETAT(get that *
one. TASHITYE(grab It, pick it up) *
They finally reach the box with the pellets. The soldiers pull *
the crate out. The crateís dimensions are as Spalko descried, *
about the size of your average coffin, but a bit thinner. *
SPALKO *
Open it! *
One of the soldiers wedges a crowbar into the slot at the side of *
the crate and starts to pry the lid open. The crowbar pulls away *
from his hand and it gets stuck on the top of the crate. The *
other soldiers also begin to pry the crate open. Finally the *
slats are pulled away, they reveal a stainless steel tank. *
The soldiers lift it and move towards a vehicle. *
The lights start to move toward the box. Indy watches and begins *
to climb down. *
 8B. 
A dozen lights dangling above swing toward the coffin, drawn to *
it. Mac looks at the floor, as the steel parts from the broken *
crates begin to also move toward the coffin. *
Spalko follows the coffin from behind a line of soldiers. *
The others carry the coffin to the open truck. The dog tags from *
their necks are drawn to the magnetism. They are all struggling *
with their rifles, trying to keep them from being pulled away by *
the coffin. *
Spalko moves to the box on the truck, she tries to feel it with *
her hand. Her sward rises towards the box. Spalko brings it down, *
she takes it off and hands it to Dovchenko. *
Indy watches from the top of the boxes, he heads down and joins *
Mac on the floor. *
One of the soldiers opens the lid, as he does this, his glasses *
are pulled off his face and get stuck on the cover. We catch a *
glimpse of the stencilling. Itís obscured, but what we can make *
out reads-- *
 ROSWELL, N.M. 7-9-47 *
Spalko climbs onto the truck, looking into the glass covering, *
she opens it. Inside, we see only a shape, wrapped in silvery *
metallic wrapping of some kind. *
SPALKO *
Fanari.(flashlights) *
Indy is watching with Mac, Indy tries to move closer, the soldier *
carrying his whip steps in front of him. His rifle aimed at Indy. *
Spalko gets a knife and begins to cut the bag down the middle. *
As it breaks its seal, there is a HISS and a heavy gas escapes, *
swirling. Spalko leans forward, breathless, as at the end of a *
long quest. She peels the wrapping away from the top portion of *
the shape. The inside of the wrapping holds the shape of what it *
was wrapped around -- a humanoid head, somewhat elongated *
cranium, and the sygomatic arches of an oversized pair of eyes. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
MOYO- ZOLOTSE(sunshine) *
The Russian Soldiers lean forward, fascinated and distracted-- *
Indy looks at Mac, decides to seize the distraction as the *
soldier looks back. Indy hits him and GRABS HIS BULLWHIP, hanging *
over the shoulder of the Russian guarding him. He shoulder- blocks *
the Russian, who falls back. Spalko stands and looks at Indy. *
 9. 
The Soldier (FRANKLIN) guarding Mac spins his aim toward Indy, *
but --
-- Indyís bullwhip CRACKS, the lash wraps around the Soldierís *
tip of his gun-- *
-- the fallen Russian (KEVIN)swings his gun around, aiming it at *
Indy --
-- Indy flicks his wrist, causing the 2nd Soldier (FRANKLIN)to *
fire his gun, and the bullets --
-- SLAM INTO THE RUSSIAN ON THE GROUND,(Kevin) killing him. *
Indy flicks his arm again, causing Macís guard to loose the gun, *
Mac catches it--
-- Indy bends down and scoops up the dead Russianís weapon. *
The remaining Russian Soldiers spin their guns around, but too
late -- Indy is standing beside Mac, theyíre now back to back, *
the old friends, both armed, holding the Russians at bay. Indy *
still holding onto his whip under the gun. *
INDY
Drop the guns! *
(aiming at Spalko)
Or Colonel Doctor Spalko is dead. *
The Soldiers start to lower their weapons, but then something
funny happens. Dovchenko smiles. *
And the Soldiers raise their weapons again. Puzzled, Indy turns
and sees the last thing he ever expected --
The barrel of Macís gun, pointing directly at Indyís head.
INDY (contíd)
Why Mac? Why? *
MAC
What can I say, Jonsy, Iím a capitalist. *
And they paid. *
INDY *
After all those years we spent spying on *
the Reds?! I thought we were friends *
Mac. *
*
 10. 
Mac backs away from Indy, moving to the Russians side. *
MAC
(shrugs)
Had bad luck with the cards, mate. *
Awful. Bloody awful. Canít go home *
empty-handed no more. *
SPALKO
No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?
INDY
I like Ike.
Dovchenko steps forward, CLICKING the slide back on his automatic *
handgun.
DOVCHENKO
But down gun. *
INDY
You got it, pal. *
He pitches the automatic weapon from a height. *
The gun hits the floor and fires off a round. The bullet SLAMS
into the concrete, ripping right through --
-- A RUSSIAN SOLDIERíS RIGHT BOOT, blowing off two of his toes. *
As the Soldier SCREAMS, he inadvertently squeezes the trigger on
his machine gun, sending a spray of bullets flying into the air,
TINGING off trucks, CRUNCHING into crates.
Indy runs out. *
Spalko SHOUTS at the nearby Soldiers. *
SPALKO *
Dograt Yevo.(go after him) *
Spalko closes the glass case, the soldier takes his glasses off *
the cover-Spalko SLAMS the lid of the coffin closed . *
One of the soldiers closes the weapons carrier. *
Spalko gets in the driver seat and drives off *
Spalko leaps behind the wheel, hits the gas, and takes off with *
it. *
 11. 
7 ATOP THE CRATES,
Indy turns and runs down the alley, looking for some means of *
escape. The soldiers aim their weapons at him. The bullets miss *
him. There are stacks of packing crates in ever direction, *
different heights, different gaps between them. He comes to the *
end looks around, scampers up onto the pile of crates . *
The soldiers emerge from the alley, they spot Indy on top. They *
fire, the top crate EXPLODES in a fusillade of gunfire, they *
barely missing him again. *
Indy continues chasing Spalko, he CRACKS his whip -- *
-- it wraps around the light, and he swings out over the gap. *
Indy soars over the crates, and catches up to the jeep. *
We, almost. His feet are about to land on the back gate just as *
he starts his backward swing --
-- the tip of the bullwhip unravels --
-- and Indy falls backwards, CRASHING into the front seat of
another jeep, following the first one, landing right between two
Russian Soldiers. He GROANS in pain.
INDY *
Damn, I thought that was closer. *
Indy throws an elbow into the face of the Soldier on his right
and a punch into the face of the Soldier behind the wheel, they
fall out opposite sides of the jeep --
-- and Indy slides behind the wheel and ROARS away down the aisle
of the warehouse, chasing Spalko. He catches up, gives the wheel
a jerk, and SLAMS her jeep into a pile of crates.
He pushes Spalkoís jeep all the way deep into the boxes, they *
disappears. *
She goes flying out of the jeep as it comes to a sudden stop.
Indy leaps out of his own jeep and into Spalkoís, the one
carrying the box with his name on it.
The soldiers catch up and surround the area. Suddenly thereís a *
huge explosion. The soldiers get thrown up in the air, debris is *
flying everywhere. Indy slides out driving the jeep,. He throws *
it in gear and takes off, as Spalko comes out and sees him *
leaving. *
 12. 
SPALKO *
Sleyduityi zarim. (follow him!) *
Dovchenko in the truck goes after Indy. *
Spalko joins the other soldiers. As she walks away, we see: the *
contents of a smashed crate half-exposed on the floor. Thereís a *
glowing gold handle atop a bejewelled box , itís the Ark of the--- *
8 IN INDYíS JEEP, *
he races up to an intersection in the giant warehouse,
Dovechenkoís truck is following him. *
He looks back. The truck is gaining on him. *
Indy looks ahead and finds himself now HEAD ON with a sedan. *
Mac is in the sedan, carrying his rifle. *
In the narrow aisle Indy has no other place to go-- *
Mac is getting closer. *
MAC *
Donít get clever Boris. No, no, no. You *
donít know him. *
Indy looks up, and sees the hanging lamps, and the latticework of *
support beams up there.
Indy starts to climb up and reaches -- *
-- for one of the lamps- *
-- Indyís body is yanked out of the jeep with incredible force.
He flies into the air, and beneath him the brakes and Drivers of
the two oncoming vehicles SCREAM --
-- and SMASH into Indyís jeep, front and back, crumpling it like
a tin can and CRACKING OPEN the crates that were in the jeep. *
*
 13. 
Mac rolls out of the wreckage, he looks up. *
Indy is running on the rafters, getting away. *
The soldiers begin firing. *
BAM-BAM-BAM!!
Indy keeps running as gunshots RIP behind him. *
Dovchenko gets out of his truck, and begins firing with his gun. *
He chases Indy. *
Indy runs to the end of the rafters, he jumps on the chains and *
slides down. As he gets up, Dovchenko catches up to him and *
tackles him....... *
The burst through a door. *
As they come out the other side they fall down into a room with *
a glass dome. *
They fall on top and continue to fight. Indy manages to punch *
Dovchenko, on the second punch Dovchenko looses his hat. . *
The glass begins to crack, it shatters. *
9 INT. BUNKER-DAY *
Dovchenko and Indy fall through the glass, and land on a platform *
that is held by chains. *
They continue fighting, Indy is able to roll off and swing by the *
chains. Dovchenko grabs onto one of the chains. *
 13A. 
Dovchenko is hanging by the chain. Indy flies in on another chain *
and kicks Dovchenko. *
Dovchenko goes flying into the control room, crashing through the *
glass window. *
He lands hard on a control panel, a red light flashes and a *
buzzer BUZZES. The clock starts the countdown. *
Dovchenko gets up, picks up the chain. *
Indy has dropped onto the deck of a railroad flat car, set at the *
end of the train tracks that run away into the distance, into an *
underground tunnel. Thereís a jet engine crudely bolted onto he *
deck of the flat car. *
Dovchenko tries to hit Indy with the chain. Indy rolls backwards *
off the platform. Dovchenko follows him, trying to hit him with *
the chain. Indy tries to get away, he climbs back onto the *
platform. *
A set of doors at the tunnel mouth RUMBLE open. *
The turbine on the rocket ship starts to spin. *
Dovchenko grabs Indyís right foot with he chain and pulls him *
down onto the steel grate. Indy tries to get up, Dovchenko *
punches him. Indy tries again, and again Dovchenko punches him. *
Indy tries again, Dovchenko takes the chain and wraps it around *
Indyís neck. *
Dovchenko hauls Indy up by the chain. He starts to punch Indy. *
Mac with a group of soldiers carrying their guns, approach from *
the end of an access tunnel behind the flat car. *
Indy manages to get his legs around Dovchenkoís neck, he starts *
to choke him as hard as he can. Dov is loosing his breath. *
Indy gets his right foot free and kicks Dovchenko down to the *
ground. Indy comes down *
The clock is reaching zero. *
 14. 
The soldiers with Mac are just about to reach them *
-- and the jet engine ROARS to life, sending a blast of rippling
white fire ERUPTING out of the back of the rocket sled (because
that what this gizmo is), incinerating the Russian soldiers. *
Mac recoils from the blast and the engine fully engages -- boy,
does it engage, SLAMMING Indy and Dovchenko flying into a
cushioned blast shield near the back of the railroad car.
The rocket sled blasts away down the railroad tracks so fast itís
just a streak of light and ZOOMS into the tunnel. *
10 IN THE TUNNEL, *
lights strobe by as the rocket sled picks up speed in the *
underground tunnel. Indy and Dovchenko are pinned to the rear *
blast shield by the intense thrust. *
11 EXT HANGAR 51 DUSK *
As dusk falls, we see the blurry fire of the rocket sled as it *
BLASTS out the mouth of the tunnel, moving like a shooting star *
down five miles of tracks, disappearing into the distance. *
11A INT GUARD SHACK DUSK *
An MP watching the rocket, he makes a call. *
GUARD *
I need to speak to the colonel. *
A second later, thereís a sonic BOOM.
12 INT HANGAR 51 DUSK
Back in the hangar, Russian Soldiers are picking up the coffin. *
Spalko SHOUTS to them in Russian, pointing out the open hangar
door, go after them!
SPALKO *
Shivilyties. (move) Poidyomte (letís go) *
Mac out of breath joins her. The soldiers load the coffin in the *
jeep. Spalko gets in the driver seat of the remaining jeep. Mac *
joins her in the passenger seat. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
You did well. *
The drive off. *
T l f h h l d
 15. 
13 EXT ROCKET SLED NIGHT *
On the rocket sled, Indy and Dovchenko hold on for dear life as
the G forces wrap their faces around the backs of their skulls.
The desert landscape flashes by; they cover miles in moments, and
as abruptly as it started --
-- the booster engine shuts down. The rocket sled silently
glides to a halt at the end of the five mile stretch of railroad
tracks, coming to a stop with a soft little THUMP into a rubber
bumper at the end, next to a small shack with lights on.
On the flat car, Indy and Dovchenko. Indy comes to, he pushes *
Dovchenko off the flat car. *
Indy gets up, holding onto his whip, he tries to regain his *
balance, he grabs his hat and looses his footing, he falls off on *
the other side of the flat car. *
In the distance, Indy spies a plume of dust from the Russian
cars, which are pursuing him.
He takes off into the distance on wobbly lets, headed for a rocky
rise that might provide some cover.
14 EXT HANGAR 51 DUSK
Outside the front entrance to Hangar 51, another truck, this one
full of REAL U.S. MARINES, alerted by the noise of the rocket
sled, SCREECHES to a halt. The marines leap out, drawing their
weapons, and cautiously approach the entrance to the hangar.
 15A. 
15 INT HANGAR 51 DUSK *
Spalko and Mac take off out the rear of Hangar 51 just before the *
Marines enter.
CUT TO:
16 EXT DESERT NIGHT *
the jeep and sedan with the Russians inside SKID to a halt next to *
the railroad flat car.
Indy watches from behind the hill. *
Dovchenko, on the flat car, is just coming to. As the Soldiers
from the sedan tend to him, Dovchenko SHOUTS to the others,
gesturing in the direction Indy ran -- get him!
Three Russians jump back into the jeep and take off, further into
the desert.
Dovchenko limps into the sedan and it turns around, heading in *
the opposite direction, back the way they came.
DISSOLVE TO:
17 EXT DESERT TOWN DAWN *
Indy spots a small desert town on the horizon. He walks toward *
it.
 16. 10/12/07
18 EXT MAIN STREET DAY *
Indy walks into this perfect little American town--- *
--the three Russians in the American jeep cruise slowly around a *
corner, still searching for Indy. *
Indy jumps over a fence into the backyard of a prim house. *
 16A. 10/12/07
19 EXT BACK YARDS DAY *
Indy plows right through somebodyís laundry hanging on a line,
and heads for the back door of the house. *
INDY *
Hello! Hello! *
20 INT SOMEBODYíS HOUSE DUSK
Indy enters and finds himself in a perfect little kitchen, *
appointed with all the latest appliances, including a heavy-duty
refrigerator. *
INDY
Hello?! Hello?! Anybody home?! *
Indy grabs the phone, the phone line is broken. *
He hears faint MUSIC form the other room.
21 INT LIVING ROOM DUSK
Indy races into the living room, where the music is louder. Itís
the theme from the Howdy Doody Show. A family (MOM, DAD, and TWO
KIDS) is seated with their backs to him, watching Howdy on the
black and white TV set. *
INDY
Hey, hey, Russians .....(or on C) I *
knocked. You guys got a telephone. *
Nobody moves. Nobody answers. They just stare at the screen.
INDY (contíd)
Wait a minute. *
Hey, Dad isnít a dad at all and Mom isnít a mom and in fact these
arenít even real people! Theyíre MANNEQUINS.
BUFFALO BOB
Why, Howdy, havenít you guessed yet?
Itís an imaginary place!
Indy is stunned, trying to process whatís happening. *
He goes to the front door and steps out-- *
*
*
 17. 10/12/07
22 EXT HOUSE DAY *
- and onto the front lawn. A MANNEQUIN MILKMAN is frozen at the *
front walkway, holding onto a milk crate. *
Indy walks to the sidewalk. A FROZEN newspaper boy on a bicycle. *
An AIR RAID SIREN starts to WAIL. Indy is startled he bumps into *
the bicycle, the boy falls. *
Indy turns something horrible coming together in his mind. *
INDY *
Oh, that canít be good. *
INDY looks at the frozen kids standing around the Ice Cream *
Truck. The MANNEQUIN ICE CREAM MAN handing out a popsicle. *
He turns and looks at the *
MANNEQUIN MAILMAN, delivering fake mail. Across the street, a *
MANNEQUIN PEDESTRIAN is frozen in stride, walking a FAKE DOG. *
He sees a group of frozen women hanging the laundry. *
A DEAFENING VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers. *
VOICE *
All personnel take final positions. *
Countdown to detonation commencing at t- *
minus one minute. *
INDY
That canít be good at all. *
Indy looks down Main Street. *
Next to a sign, the kind that should say Welcome to Mayberry or *
something, but this one says -- *
DOOM TOWN *
U.S. Army Proving Ground CIVILIANS TURN *
BACK! *
 18. 10/12/07
23 EXT EDGE OF TOWN DUSK
-- the Russian Soldiers are walking down the street toward him, *
with their guns drawn. *
VOICE (O.S.)
T-minus forty-five seconds. *
One of the Russians turns, seeing, *
There, a few hundred yards out of town stands a metal-frame tower *
festooned with sirens and loudspeakers. Suspended beneath a *
platform in the middle-- *
-- is a NUCLEAR BOMB. *
The Russianís eyes go wide and he SCREAMS at the Soldiers in the *
jeep. *
SOLDIER *
BOZBPOWANTECB! ZTO-SOMSA! OHA *
B3APBETC!(GET BACK, ITíS A BOMB, IT WILL *
EXPLODE!) *
They hit the gas, race past Indy, the Soldier leaps inside, and *
they ROAR the hell out of Doom Town. *
INDY *
SURE, DONíT WAIT FOR ME!! *
He races a few steps after them, then realizes itís pointless. *
VOICE (O.S.) *
T-minus thirty seconds and counting. *
Indy makes a desperate decision. He turns and runs, but not out *
of town; Indy heads back into the house. *
 18A. 10/12/07
24 INT HOUSE DUSK *
Indy bursts into the same house as before, racing down the
hallway, dogged by the cheery ìHowdy Doodyî theme music. *
VOICE (O.S.)
T-minus fifteen seconds and counting.
25 INT KITCHEN DUSK
Indy runs into the kitchen and throws open the old-style
refrigerator.
VOICE (O.S.)
T-minus ten seconds and counting.
Indy yanks everything out of the fridge, shelves and all.
VOICE (O.S.) (contíd)
T-minus five seconds and counting.
Indy jumps into the fridge and SLAMS the door --
VOICE (O.S.) (contíd)
Four.
-- but the door bounces open, cans are blocking it -- *
VOICE (O.S.) (contíd) *
Three. *
-- he cleans the rest of the things out -- *
VOICE (O.S.) (contíd) *
Two. *
-- and SLAMS the door. As it closes a little metal plate on the *
corner of the door pops into focus, it reads -- *
VOICE (O.S.) (contíd) *
One. *
-- ìLEAD-LINED FOR SUPERIOR INSULATION!î *
The screen turns white. *
 19. 10/12/07
26 IN THE INCREDIBLE GLARE, *
mannequins fly apart in the blast-furnace, bodies ignite like
matchheads, Kids are swept off their bikes, Mailman and
Pedestrian turn to cinders in a split-second, the Buick and its
waving Driver tumble down the street like a flaming toy.
Walls collapse, houses implode, roofs fly away.
27 EXT DESERT DUSK
A mile away, the Russian Soldiers are driving like madmen,
getting out of town at eighty miles an hour, but it isnít fast
enough, as a BLASTWAVE OF HEAT AND DEBRIS comes rocketing across
the blast, turning sand to glass.
And in the instant before the blastwave consumes them, the last
thing the Russians see is --
-- a REFRIGERATOR zipping past them, riding the blastwave.
And then the Russians are vaporized, their jeep melting into the
desert sand. We are engulfed by dust.
DISSOLVE TO:
 20. 10/12/07
28 EXT DESERT DUSK *
A couple miles from Doom Town, the dust billows away to reveal a *
scorched, half-melted refrigerator lying in a pile of debris. *
We hear THUMPING from within, the latch gives, and the door
swings up with a heave. Indy emerges, unsteady on his feet. He
staggers toward us,
A prairie dog is watching him *
INDY *
What are you looking at? *
Indy gets up and grabs his whip from the refrigerator, he heads *
up the hill. *
As he settles gazing up with horror and awe at -- *
A HUGE MUSHROOM CLOUD, rising up over the desert floor. Indy
stands there, silhouetted against the billowing, seething cloud,
and is it our imagination or, with its creepy, hollowed-out eye
sockets, does that deadly cloud bear a strong resemblance --
-- to a human skull?
CUT TO:
 21. 10/15/07
29 INT DECONTAMINATION ROOM DAY *
Indy, exhausted, is in a decontamination room Heís surrounded
by FOUR SOLDIERS in medical gowns and goggles who are scrubbing
him roughly with long-handled brushes.
Two shadowy men in dark suits and skinny ties, SMITH and TAYLOR,
stand a short distance away, regarding him suspiciously. A SMALL
MAN with a Geiger counter waves a metal wand across Indyís body.
There are few, if any, CLICKS.
A SOLDIER IN UNIFORM enters and hands smith a paper. He enters *
the room. Indy is seated on a table, Taylor is standing on the *
other side. *
SMITH
Your story appears to check out. But *
Iím still mystified, Dr. Jones, as to
why you were in the Russian car in the
first place.
INDY
I told you, I was knocked unconscious
and kidnapped from a dig in Mexico. I
woke up I was in the trunk of that car. *
SMITH
Along with your good friend George
McHale?
INDY
I had no reason to believe Mac was a spy.
He was MI6 when I was O.S.S., we did *
twenty or thirty missions together in *
Europe and the Pacific, weTAYLOR
Donít wave your war record in our face,
Colonel Jones, we all served.
INDY *
No kidding? What side were you on? *
Smith starts to walk in back of Indy, as Taylor crosses in front . *
SMITH *
I donít think you understand the gravity *
of your situation. You aided and abetted *
KGB operatives who broke into a (he *
sits) secret military installation, in *
the heart of the United States of *
America. My country. *
 21A. 10/17/07
INDY *
What was in that steel box they took? *
TAYLOR (AS HE LEANS ON THE *
TABLE)
You tell us. Youíve seen it before. *
INDY *
You mean that Air force fiasco in ë47? I *
was tossed into a bus with blacked out *
windows and twenty people I wasnít *
allowed to speak(talk) to-- hauled out *
in the middle of the night to the middle *
of nowhere on some urgent recovery *
project and shown - what? Pieces of *
wreckage and an intensely magnetic *
shroud covering--(still unsure what it *
was)-- mutilated remains? None of us *
were every given the full picture and we *
were threatened with treason if we ever *
talked about it. So you tell me-- what *
was in the box? *
TAYLOR *
This process works best when we ask the *
question, Dr. Jones. *
INDY *
Mummified remains? *
SMITH *
Our records donít indicate anything of *
that nature was housed there. *
TAYLOR *
You must be confused, Dr. Jones. *
SMITH *
the only thing that facility stores is *
replacement parts for B series aircraft. *
 22. 
The door BANGS open and a two-star Army General barrels into the *
room -- GENERAL ROSS. Around Indyís age, big man, big voice.
GENERAL ROSS
Indy, thank God! Donít you know itís *
dangerous to climb into a refrigerator? *
Those things are death traps!
Ross is smiling, heís kidding. Indy smiles back.
INDY
Good to see you too, Bob.
GENERAL ROSS
(to Smith and Taylor)
Relax, boys, I can vouch for Dr. Jones.
INDY
(to Ross)
What the hellís going on? KGB on
American soil? Who was that woman? *
TAYLOR
Describe her.
INDY *
Tall, thin, mid-thirties. She carried *
a sword of some kind -- a rapier, I *
think. Knew how to use it, too. *
Smith and Taylor exchange a look -- they recognize that *
description. Taylor steps out of the room quickly. *
Through a glass panel, we see Taylor, outside the room, pick up a *
phone and make a call. *
 23. 
Ross produces a file from his briefcase and flips it open, *
showing Indy a surveillance photograph of Spalko. Indy picks up *
the file and looks at it. *
INDY (contíd) *
Yeah, thatís her. *
SMITH
(to Indy)
Youíre sure sheís here?
INDY
Here and gone. Who is she?
Smith doesnít answer Indy. But General Ross does. *
GENERAL ROSS
Irina Spalko, Stalinís fair-haired girl. *
His favorite scientist, if you can call
psychic research science.
Smith steps in, trying to end this conversation. Indy looks *
through the file. *
SMITH
General Ross.
GENERAL ROSS
Sheís leading teams from the Kremlin all
over the world, scooping up artifacts
she thinks might have paranormal *
military applications. SheísSMITH
General Ross.
Smith takes the file from Indy and closes it. Ross turns, and *
Smith gives him an icy glare.
GENERAL ROSS *
Back off, Paul. Not everyone in the *
Army is a Commie. And certainly not *
Indy. *
Ross sits at the head of the table. Indy also sits and puts his *
feet up. *
 24. 
INDY *
What exactly am I being accused with, *
besides surviving a nuclear blast? *
Outside, Taylor hangs up the phone and re-enters the room.
SMITH
Nothing yet. But frankly, your
association with George McHale calls
into question all your activities,
including those during the war.
GENERAL ROSS
are you nuts? Do you have any idea how *
many medals this son of a bitch has won?
SMITH
A great many, Iím sure. But does he
deserve them?
TAYLOR
Dr. Jones, letís just say for now that
you are of interest to the Bureau.
SMITH
Of great interest.
INDY
Look, you got any doubts about me, talk *
to congressman Freleng. Or Abe Portman *
in Army Intel. Hell, ask anybody, Iíve
got a lot of friends in Washington! *
TAYLOR
I think, Professor, youíll find you
might be wrong about that.

30 EXT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS DAY
A beautiful college campus. A big banner tells us Homecoming is
this Saturday. But OMINOUS FOOTSTEPS echo over the quad.
 25. 
31 INT CAMPUS BUILDING DAY
a pair of dress shoes CLICK down a hallway in one of the
buildings. DEAN CHARLES STANFORTH, sixtyish, stops at a door and *
looks *
THROUGH THE WINDOW,
we see Indy, dressed in his tweedy professorís garb, teaching a
class. *
INDY *
--a period of time distinguished with the *
use of Groove Ware and the *
beginnings of modern drainage practices, *
which we also see in Skara Brae, on the *
west coast of Scotland. *
32 INSIDE THE CLASSROOM, *
Stanforth slips quietly inside and leans against the wall. *
INDY *
Skara Brae dates back to 3100 B.C. And *
was continuously occupied for a period *
of about six hundred years until its *
apparent abandonment in 2500 B.C. *
Thereís no clear(solid) evidence as to *
why its- *
He stops and looks at Stanforth. Stanforth looks grim. Indy *
stumbles, knows something's up. *
INDY (contíd) *
Its inhabitants decided to abandon to, *
uh, leave a perfectly healthy *
settlement(environment) (to Stanforth) *
Yes? *
STANFORTH *
May I have a moment, Professor? *
INDY *
Yes of course. *
Indy turns back in and addresses his class. *
INDY (contíd) *
Uh, open up Michaelson, review chapter *
four. When I come back weíll discuss the *
difference between migration(emigration) *
and exodus. *
 26. 
He steps into the hall, closing the door behind him.
The STUDENTS lean forward to hear whatís going on outside.
INDY (O.S.) (contíd)
WHAT?!
The Students look up sharply. Indy and the Dean are visible
through the glass; Indy looks like heís going to clobber him.
33 OUT IN THE HALLWAY,
Stanforthís trying to calm him.
STANFORTH
You have no idea the pressure coming
from the Board of Regents. The FBI
showed up this morning, they ransacked
your office, searched all your files --
INDY
And you didnít stop them? Youíre the
dean of this college, they have no right! *
STANFORTH
They had every right! They werenít
vandals, they were federal agents with
search warrants. The Universityís not
going to let itself be embroiled in that
kind of controversy, not in this *
charged climate. *
Indy leads Stanforth down the hallway. *
INDY
So youíre firing me?
STANFORTH
A leave of absence, is all. An *
indefinite leave of absence --
INDY
You are firing me!
STANFORTH
-- during which they have agreed to
continue to pay your full salary for a
period ofINDY
I donít want their money. Iíll tell you *
what they can do with their money. *

STANFORTH
Please donít be foolish, you donít know
what I had to go through to get that for
you.
INDY
What you went through?(what you had to go *
through?) What exactly did you have to *
go through, Charlie?
STANFORTH
Henry. I resigned. *
Indy just looks at him, dumbfounded.
CUT TO:
 27A. 
34 INT INDYíS HOUSE DAY
Indy is folding a shirt, he puts it in a suitcase thatís on the
bed in Indyís bedroom.
Stanforth is standing in the archway. Theyíre halfway through a
bottle of red wine, middle of the afternoon.
STANFORTH
Where will you go?
INDY
Train to New York, overnight to London,
for starters. Might end up teaching in
Leipzig, Heinrich owes me a favor.
Indy moves to the closet, opens up one of the drawers and takes
out some clothes. He moves back to the bed.
INDY (contíd)
Iíll wire you when I get settled and you
can send the rest of my things
He goes back to the closet and gets a couple of belts, he walks
back to the packing.
STANFORTH
I suppose thereís nothing to keep you
here. I barely recognize this country
anymore, the governmentís got us seeing
communists in our soup. When the
hysteria reaches academia, I guess itís
time to call it a career.
Indy picks up his glass and moves to the living room.
INDY
Howíd Deirdre take the news?
Stanforth follows.
STANFORTH
How does any wife take such things? The
look on her face was a combination of
pride and panic.
Stanforth finishes his drink. Indy moves to his desk and opens
the drawers.
INDY
I never should have doubted you, my
friend.
 28. 
STANFORTH
We seem to be at the age where life stops
giving us things and starts taking them
away.
Pause. Wow, bummer. Then they both snap out of it at the same
time, Indy bolting up to resume packing while Stanforth reaches
for the wine.
STANFORTH (contíd)
Maybe just another half a glass...
Indy goes to his desk and rifles through some papers, takes a
few, including his passport, throws out some others.
STANFORTH (contíd)
I wish youíd met someone like Deirdre,
to help you through times like this. Or
if youíd realized it when you did meet
her...
INDY
Letís not tug on that thread right now,
okay pal?
Stanforth holds his hands up in surrender, okay, Iíll drop it.
He notices his watch.
STANFORTH
Good Lord, Iíve got to get home. Don and
Maggie are driving spousum et familia up
from the city for dinner. Emergency
family council meeting.
INDY
(with a touch of envy)
Theyíre good kids.
STANFORTH
Healthy and employed, Iíll settle for
that. Iím off.
(stands, sways from the wine)
And I believe I should walk.
INDY
Thank you for what you did, my friend.
STANFORTH
I cut quite the dramatic figure. The
Regents were stunned into shamed
silence. At least thatís the way Iíll
tell it to the grandkids.
 29. 
STANFORTH
Healthy and employed, Iíll settle for
that. Iím off.

And I believe I should walk.
INDY
Good idea.
Indy stands and moves to Stanforth. He fixes his jacket
INDY (contíd)
Thank you my friend, for what you did.
STANFORTH
I cut quite the dramatic figure.
INDY
I bet you did.
They move towards the door.
STANFORTH
the Regents were stunned into shamed
silence. At least thatís the way Iíll
tell it to the grandchildren.
Indy opens the front door. Stanforth turns to Indy with one last
thought.
STANFORTH (contíd)
you know, when youíre young you spend
all your time thinking ìWho will I be?î
And for years youíre busy shouting at the
world ìthis is who I am!î But lately
Iíve been wondering -- after Iím gone,
who will they say I was?
Stanforth leaves. Indy looks for a moment.
INDY
Bye Charlie.
He closes the door.
 29A. 
35 EXT TRAIN STATION DAY
-- and weíre at the train station, the sound is the trainís
WHISTLE as it gets ready to pull out. Indy gets out of a cab in *
the parking lot. *
A sedan arrives with DIMITRI and his two ASSOCIATES--all dressed *
in suits. When Dimitri looks to his associate in the back seat, *
the man give him the ìgo ahead.î They pull away. *
As Indy hurries up the steps to the platform carrying his *
suitcase, a ìHarley Davidsonî MOTORCYCLE glides to a halt. *
Indy walks down the platform between two trains. Pausing on the *
step of his train car, he glances back to his city. And just as *
he steps into the car, two of the men in suits slip aboard at the *
other end of the train. They are following him. *
After Indy finds his seat, a MOTORCYCLE RIDER in a black leather *
jacket, jeans, boots, cap, and leather gloves cruises up the *
platform. He seems to be looking for someone. *
MUTT WILLIAMS is twenty, American, and impatient. As the TRAIN *
WHISTLE blows one last time, he spots Indy. *
Mutt whips the bike into a quick turn. *
36 ON THE PLATFORM
The train starts to pull out of the station. *
Mutt pulls even with Indyís train car, and SHOUTS to him. *
MUTT
Hey! Mister! Hey, buddy!
(louder)
Hey Professor!
Indy turns. *
MUTT (contíd)
Are you Dr. Jones? *
Indy nods, then look sup ahead, at the end of the platform. *
INDY
Youíre running out of platform, kid.

He turns. Mutt SHOUTS: *

Youíre a friend of Dr. Oxley, right? *
Indy turns back. He knows the name. *
INDY *

38 INT BERNIEíS DINER DAY
Saturday afternoon. Letter sweaters, saddle shoes, a juke box
playing ìWake up Little Suzieî Mostly COLLEGE TYPES in the
place, but a dozen GREASERS in the back drinking beer, looking
for trouble.
A LETTERMEN walks up to the jukebox about to select a song. One of
the GREASERS puts his hand on his head and spins around, the
Lettermen walks back to his table
Indy and Mutt are in the diner, a waitress pours coffee at their
table
Mutt turns his hat over and picks up a photograph hands it to
Indy. CLOSE ON a photograph of Mutt, a few years younger,
standing next to a BOOKISH MAN in his mid-fifties, more buttoneddown than the second floor of Brooks Brothers.
INDY (O.S.)
I havenít talked to Harold Oxley in
twenty years. We lost touch. We had a
falling out. He cut me off, angry about
something or other. I never found out
about what it was. Too bad, heís a
brilliant guy. He could put you to sleep
by talking though.
MUTT
when I was a kid, thatís how I did get to
sleep. The Ox was better than a glass of
warm milk.(offers his hand) Nameís Mutt
Williams.
INDY
ìMutt?î What kind of name is that?
MUTT
Itís the one I picked, you got a problem
with that?
INDY
Take it easy. What was Oxley your uncle
or something? (what was your
relationship to Oxley?)
MUTT
Kind of. My dad died in the war and the
Ox helped my mom raise me.
He pulls a comb from his back pocket and dips it in a glass of
coke on the table next to him. He runs it through his carefully
kept hair.
 32. 
INDY
You said they were going to kill him.
Mutt puts his comb away and leans in closer to Indy.
MUTT
About six months ago my mom got a letter
from the Ox. He was down in Peru. He
said he found some kind of skull, crystal
skull, like the one that guy MitchellHodgkins, Mitchell-Hodgkins found.
 32A. 
He turns and grabs a bottle of beer off the tray of a WAITRESS
serving the table next to them. (She doesnít see.)
INDY
The Ox and I were obsessed with the
Mitchell-Hedges skull when we were in
college. How do you know about it?
Indy takes the beer from Mutt and puts it back on the Waitressís
tray. (She doesnít see that either.)
MUTT
You kidding? Ox could talk about that
thing till the cows came home. Thatís all
he talked about. What was it, like an
idol?
INDY
Itís a deity carving. Meso-American.
Thereís a few crystal skulls in the
world. I saw one in the British Museum.
Theyíre impressive craftsmanship, but
thatís about it.
MUTT
Oxley said the skull had psychic powers.
INDY
Like, ìStare into its eyes and itíll
drive you crazy?î
MUTT
Laugh all you want, but Ox said he found
it this time. This was real, and he was
on his way to a place called Akator with
it.
Indy sits forward -- now heís interested.
INDY
Akator?
MUTT
Akator.
INDY
He said that? Are you sure?
MUTT
Akator, thatís what he said. (or)Yeah. What is it?
 33. 
INDY
Itís a mythical, a lost city in the
Amazon. The Conquistadors called it El
Dorado. Supposedly the Ugha tribe were
chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago to
build a great(giant) city out of solid
gold.
 (MORE)
 33A. 
INDY (contíd)
With aqueducts, paved roads, technology
that wouldnít be sees again for another
five thousand years. Francesco de
Orellana disappeared into the Amazon
looking for it in 1546. I almost
died(myself) of typhus(myself) looking
for it. I donít think it exists.
MUTT
Why would Ox want to take the skull
there?
INDY
The legend says that a crystal skull was
stolen from Akator in the fifteenth or
sixteenth century. That whoever returns
this skull to the cityís temple will be
given control over its power.(powers)
MUTT
Power? (powers) (so there is some kind
of power)What kind of power?
INDY
I donít know, kid. Itís just a story.
MUTT
From his letter, my mom thought the Ox
was off his rocker. (taps his head) Smog
in the nogginí. Goes down to find him,
only he had already been kidnapped, and
now theyíve got her too. Ox hid(buried)
the skull somewhere, and if my mom
doesnít come up with it, theyíre gonna
kill ëem both. She said youíd help me.
INDY
Me? Whatís your momís name, again?
MUTT
Mary, Mary williams. You remember her?
INDY
There were a lot of Maryís, kid.
Mutt slams the table and gets up.
MUTT
Shut up, man, your talking about my
mother. Thatís my mother. Donít, alright,
thatís my mother!
 34. 
INDY
Look, you donít have to get sore all the
time to prove how tough you are, okay?
Sit down, relax, please sit down. You
want my help or not?
 34A. 
MUTT
My mom said if anybody could find the
skull itís you. Like youíre some type
of grave robber or something.
INDY
Iím a teacher.(Iím a professor) ( Iím a
tenure professor)
MUTT
Youíre a teacher. (perfect- just our
luck, just my luck youíre a teacher.
Youíre a teacher thatís a big help. That
should be a big help. Youíre a teacher
great I love teachers) She called me two
weeks ago from South America, told me
she escaped but they were after her.
She said sheíd just mailed me a letter
from the Ox, and I was suppose to give it
to you. Then the line went dead.
Mutt pulls an envelope from his jacket and gives it to Indy, who
opens it and pulls out a single page.
MUTT (contíd)
I opened it. Itís pointless the thingís
gibberish, though, itís not even English
lettering.
INDY
Wait a minute.
He nods toward the soda counter-- the two bulky Guys from the
train station have followed them here.
INDY (contíd)
Those two bricks over at the counter.
Are not here for the milkshakes.
He follows their gaze down to the letter he holds in his hand.
They seem awfully interested in it, suddenly alert.
Indy folds the letter and slips it in his jacket pocket as the
bulky Guys approach the table.
MUTT
who are they?
INDY
I don't know. Maybe FBI.
The Bulky Guys arrive at the table. They speak with Russian
accents.
 35. 
RUSSIAN 1
Come quietly, Dr. Jones.
 35A. 
INDY
Make that KGB.
RUSSIAN 1
And bring letter with you.
INDY
(to the Russian)
Letter? What letter?
RUSSIAN 1
Letter Mr. Williams just give you.
MUTT
Do I look like a mailman?
RUSSIAN 2
We donít ask again. Come now orCLICK!
Mutt has popped open a switchblade, which he holds behind his
folded arms, itís long nasty blade shining in the light.
MUTT
Or what?
INDY
Nice try, kid, but I think you brought a
knife --
CLICK CLICK!
Both Russians take out their handguns pointing out from their
jackets.
INDY (contíd)
-- to a gunfight.
RUSSIAN 1
(gesturing)
Outside. Now.
Indy puts his hat on and grabs his briefcase. Mutt picks up his
hat, and puts his knife away. They both start to move out.
The Russians lead them across the crowded diner, walking slowly
behind them, their hands inside their coats menacingly.
Indy looks around, thinking wildly.
The pass A LETTERMEN standing, talking to a GIRL IN A POODLE
SKIRT(SASHA)
 36. 
Indy looks at them, and at Mutt.
INDY
(to Mutt) Punch that guy.
MUTT
Who?
 36A. 
INDY
(gesturing to the Letterman)
Joe College. Hit him. Hard.
Mutt gets it. He grins --
MUTT
Hold this.(motioning with his hat)
-- the guy turns, and Mutt SMASHES him in the face. There are
SHOUTS and SCREAMS from around them as the Letterman goes down.
GIRL IN THE POODLE SKIRT (SASHA)
Thatís my boyfriend.
She punches Mutt, and then the Letterman punches Mutt.
Mutt lands next to the GREASERS, they take off their glasses and
get ready.
Indy grabs the girl and pushes her aside, he hurls his suitcase
pushes a table, it falls blocking the Russians.
The Russians see whatís happening and try to move through the
crowd, towards Indy, -- Indy sees them approaching, he puts his
hat on one of the students and ducks.
2ND LETTERMAN
GET THAT GREASER!
THEY ALL LEAP into the fray, swinging chairs and fists. MAYHEM!
They leap into the fray, swinging chairs and fists. Mayhem!
Somebodyís tossed into the jukebox; ìWake up Little Suzie changes
over to ìShake, Rattle and Roll.î
Mutt and Indy take off, headed for the front door.
The Russians fight to get to Indy and Mutt but itís chaos now and
they canít get to them before theyíre out the door.
 37. 
39 INT ALLEY DAY
Indy and Mutt race down the sidewalk, where Muttís motorcycle is
parked. Mutt, putting on his gloves, leaps on board, Indy
thinks, fast:
INDY
Your mom didnít escape, they let her go.
So she could mail the letter, and you
could bring it to me and I could
translate it.
MUTT
(kicks it to life with a ROAR)
Get on Grumps, time to cut out!
Indy has no choice but to hop on the bike. Mutt hits the gas and
the bike kicks a wheelie as it ROARS out of the alley.
The Russians finally make it out of the diner. A girl grabs hold
of Russian #1ís neck. He throws her off, they look around, see
hem at the bikes.
They run down the sidewalk.
The Russian sedanís SCREECH around a corner and pull up to them.
They get in, the cars roar out after them.
 38. 
40 ON BOARD THE BIKE,
Indy clings to Mutt as the kid races through the used-to-bepeaceful American streets. Theyíre putting distance between
themselves and the Russian sedan, but now a --
-- SECOND SEDAN ROARS out of a side street and pulls up alongside
them on the left. The sedan edges over toward Mutt, both driving
at high speed.
DIMITRI *
BLIZHEI! (closer) *
Muttís got no room to maneuver, theyíre squeezing him up
alongside a speeding bus, theyíre getting crushed. RUSSIAN ARMS *
reach out the open back window of the sedan. *
Indy turns and punches Dimitri, his hat flies off. The Russian *
grabs hold of Indy -- *
DIMITRI *
SVOLOCH! (bastard) TEPER TRIMOI!(now *
youíre mine) *
-- and drag him right off the motorcycle!
41 INT RUSSIAN CAR DAY
Indy gets hauled into the back seat of the Russian sedan, but he
KICKS the driver, knocking off his hat, then turns and PUNCHES *
DIMITRI, until he knocks him out. Indy crawls, toward the open *
window on the other side of the seat.
THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW,
we can see Mutt drop behind the car, then gun the bike and speed
up, approaching the left side of the sedan.
Indy gets a hold of the window frame and boosts himself out of *
the window-- *
42 EXT STREET DAY
-- and is hanging half out of the car when Mutt ROARS up
alongside him.
Indy grabs onto the motorcycle but doesnít quite nail the
landing. Hanging onto the bar on the back of the seat, heís
dragged behind the motorcycle for a good fifty yards before Mutt
sees whatís going on -- *
 38A. 
-- TAPS the brakes --
-- and Indy sails up into the air, over the slowing motorcycle,
SLAMS into Muttís back, and lands hard on the seat behind him.
The bus and sedan continue down the street as the bike peels off *
across oncoming traffic and through an iron gate. The black sedan *
follows crashing through the closing iron gate, breaking off the *
gate on one side as it goes through. *
The bike and sedan#2 continue through the courtyard and the bike *
leads the sedan through an archway tunnel and into another open *
area. *
The sedan continues chasing the bike up to the point where the *
bike goes through a narrow passageway with a gothic arch. The *
passageway is too narrow and the sedan has to stop. The sedan *
then backs away from the passageway. *
The bike continues on through a series of archway passages as *
people jump out of the way. *
At the end of the last archway the bike enters the flow of *
traffic again. *
The sedan chases the bike again as it re-enters traffic until the *
bike turns off the road... *
Onto a smaller walkway, and then turns off the walkway and goes *
up the stairs into the library. *
The sedan stops and then backs out. *
44 EXT BUSY STREET DAY *
-- onto a busy street, where Mutt guns it. The #1 sedan his at *
the corner and sees them drive by. Dimitri yells at the driver to *
follow them. The sedan is immediately on them again giving chase *
as Mutt heads for: *
He drives through another archway and into an open field in the *
middle of the buildings. *
45 THE CENTER OF TOWN, *
where thereís a demonstration going on, a SPEAKER, banners,
placards. The motorcycle zips neatly through them, but the sedan
isnít so nimble.
A STUDENT leaps out of the way of the sedan and his placard SLAPS
across the windshield.
 39. 
INSIDE THE SEDAN,
we can read the placards--as they hit the windshield. *
Mutt gets the idea to run over the large ìBETTER DEAD THAN REDî *
SIGN. He runs the motorcycle through the pole, the sign falls on *
the windshield. The car drives blindly, it tears apart. *
46 OMITTED *
47 OMITTED *
 39A. 
48 The car SMASHES into the base of a statue of Marcus Brody. *
The crash causes the head of the statue to break off, it rolls *
down and crashes through the windshield. It lands on the driverís *
lap. *
Mutt and Indy watch. Mutt is happy with himself. The second sedan *
appears out of the nearby archway. Mutt takes off, the sedan *
chases after them. *
As Mutt ROARS AWAY, Dimitri and the driver get out of the car. *
The driver hands the head to Dimitri, he drops the head. *
*
 40. 
43 INT LIBRARY DAY *
-- the school library. The bike ROARS into the main reading *
room, sending books and magazines flying into the air. STUDENTS *
dive out of the way, Indy SHOUTS . *
INDY *
This is the library, youíre going too *
fast! *
MUTT *
Hey, hey! Split, split. Move, move, get *
out of the way! *
Students dive out of the way, one student carrying an armload of *
books is standing still, he screams. *
Mutt sees him and also screams, he turns, just missing the *
student. His wheels spin out from under him and the bike lays *
down, right in the middle of the reading room. *
Mutt and Indy slide across the room , crashing under the tables. *
They come to a stop, right in front of a seated student. *
STUDENT *
Excuse me, Dr. Jones. *
INDY *
Yes. *
STUDENT *
Iíve got a quick question about *
Hargroveís normative culture models -- *
Mutt gets up, Indy hops on the back of the bike. *
INDY *
Forget Hargrove. Read Vere Gordon *
Childe on diffusionism, he spent most of *
his life in the field. *
Mutt kicks the bikeís starter and it ROARS back to life. *
INDY (contíd) *
If you wanna be a good archaeologist you *
gotta -- *
Mutt guns it and the bike takes off, Indy SHOUTING back -- *
INDY (contíd) *
-- GET OUT OF THE LIBRARY! *
The bike ROARS away *
 40A. 
49 EXT INDYíS HOUSE DUSK *
Indy goes to the bookshelves. He pulls down a thick book, flips
to a section in the middle. He moves to the couch. Mutt is
looking around.
MUTT
is this your pad? Itís the first place
theyíll look for us, we should get out of
here!
INDY
Just give me a minute.
Indy sits and pulls Oxleyís letter from his pocket and studies
it. He pulls a pair of glasses from his pocket and slips them on.
He compares the symbols there with the symbols in Oxleyís letter.
Mutt looks at himself in the mirror, he starts to comb his hair.
INDY (contíd)
Just what I thought so. Koihoma.
MUTT
Whatís that?
INDY
An extinct Latin American language. (he
grabs a small journal and a pencil) PreColumbian syllabary system. See these
diagonal stresses on the ideogams?
Definitely Koihoma.
MUTT
You speak it?
Mutt takes out a stick of gum and begins to chew.
INDY
Nobody speaks it, it hasnít been heard
out loud in three thousand years. Might
be able to read a little --
He flips to another page, further in the book, also covered with
ancient symbols. He MUTTERS to himself, comparing the two pages
and scribbling on the journal.
INDY (contíd)
-- if I walk it through Mayan first.
 41. 
MUTT
You know, for an old man, you ainít bad
in a fight.
INDY
Thanks a lot.
MUTT
So what are you, like eighty?
Still working, Indy laughs through the desire to punch Mutt in
the face. Doesnít look at him.
INDY
Hard liviní, kid. I am not recommending
it.
He holds up the page heís written, reading from it.
INDY (contíd)
ìFollow the lines in the earth that only
the gods can read which lead to
Orellanaís cradle, guarded by the living
dead.î
(an idea)
Only the gods can read.
Heís talking about the Nazca Lines.
MUTT
What are those?
Indy stands and goes back to the book shelf.
INDY
Geoglyphs. Here we go.
He finds the book and walks back to Mutt, he flips through it,
searching for a certain page.
INDY (contíd)
Giant ancient drawings, scratched into
the desert floor in Peru. From the
ground they donít look like anything, but
from the air (sky)-- ah!
He spins the book around to face Mutt, who bends over to examine
it. Two whole pages are devoted to serial photographs of
beautiful carvings in the Peruvian desert. One looks like a
monkey, another like a spider, a hummingbird -- and a largeheaded humanoid figure.
 42. 
INDY (contíd)
Only the gods can read them, because the
gods --
(gesturing)
-- live up there.(this is before
airplanes) Oxleyís telling us the skull
is in Nazca, Peru. And itís a good bet
the Russians are the ones who have him.
The Kremlin probably think the skull has
some potential as a weapon, thatís why
theyíre after it.
MUTT
If it gets my mom back, they can have it.
Letís go, and try not to slow me down.
Mutt starts to head for the door, but Indy is thinking
INDY
Akator. That would be the find of a
lifetime.
Indy moves to the bedroom
INDY (contíd)
Create a reputation no politician could
touch.
50 INT INDYíS BEDROOM DUSK
BAM! Indy SMACKS open the closet door in his bedroom. His hat
is still there, in the foreground, and the whip is curled on the
top shelf, the handle sticking out.
 43. 
RETAKE 8-31-07- INT. INDYíS HOUSE- DUSK
MUTT
So what are you , like, eighty?
Still working, Indy looks up holding the letter.
INDY
Itís a riddle. Leave it to Oxley to write
a riddle in a dead language. ìFollow the
lines in the earth that only the gods can
read which led to Orellanaís cradle,
guarded by the living dead.î(an Idea- he
gets up) heís talking about the Nazca
Lines.
Indy walks to back to the bookshelf.
MUTT
What are those? (what are they?)
Indy grabs a large book.
INDY
Here we go. Geoglyphs.
He walks back to Mutt, flips through it, finds the page. Two whole
pages are devoted to aerial photographs of beautiful carvings in
the Peruvian desert. One looks like a monkey, another like a
spider, a hummingbird -- and a large headed humanoid figure.
INDY (contíd)
Giant ancient drawings, carved into the
desert floor in Nazca Peru. From the
ground they donít look like
much(anything) but from the sky-- (he
takes his glasses off) Only the gods can
read, because only gods- (gesturing) live
up there. Oxleyís telling us the skull is
in Nazca, Peru. And itís a good bet the
Russians have him. The Kremlin probably
thinks the skull has some potential as a
weapon, thatís why theyíre after it.
MUTT
Look teach, if it gets my mom back, they
can have whatever they want. Letís
go(letís split)
Mutt starts to head for the door, but Indy is thinking and stops
him.
 43A. 
INDY
Akator.
He moves to his bedroom.
INDY (contíd)
Akator. It would be the find of a
lifetime.
He goes to the closet.
INDY (contíd)
Create a reputation no politician could
touch.
Indy picks up his hat- CLOSE ON THE HAT!
 43B. 
51 BEGIN TRAVEL MONTAGE.
A series of dissolves takes place against a moving map with an *
animated red line.
51A From the East Coast they make their way southwest to Mexico City, *
Mexico City airport *
Muttís motorcycle is being carted towards the cargo hold of a *
ëPANAGRAí plane. Mutt watches them, Indy tips one of the workers. *
Indy carries a rucksack. *
51B As the red line moves toward the desert coast of Peru, *
INT. PANAGRA PLANE-DAY *
Mutt is busy cleaning his bike, Indy watches him, he tries to get *
some sleep. *
The plane continues traveling *
Indy and Mutt are looking out the window, the plane makes a turn. *
Indy and Mutt move to the other side of the plane. There, *
scratched into the desert floor below, are the actual Nazca *
Lines. *
51C The red line reaches its end *
The Panagra plane takes off again, revealing Indy, the bike, and *
Mutt standing in a desert airstrip, with a few chickens running *
around. *
NAZCA, PERU *
CUT TO: *
 43C. 10/15/07
52 EXT NAZCA DAY *
The windswept desert city of Nazca is like Casablanca -- teaming,
international, dangerous. And hot. Always, everywhere, hot.
Muttís motorcycle is chained to a metal post outside a cantina at
the edge of a town square. Muttís at an outdoor table beside it,
finishing a bottle of Coke, adding it to a pyramid of five others
in front of him. Looks bored, heís been there a while.
Indy is nearby, speaking to a couple LOCALS in Spanish, getting
an animated story from them. He finishes and rejoins Mutt.
INDY
Finally -- they saw him. Ox came
wondering into town a few months ago,
raving like a mad man. The police locked
him up in a sanitarium. Itís this way.
MUTT
Me motto.
He starts walking. Mutt falls into stride alongside him.
MUTT (CONTíD)
I took Spanish, man, I didnít understand
a word of that. What was it?
INDY
Quechua. Local Incan dialect.
MUTT
Whereís you learn that one?
INDY
Long story.
MUTT
I got time.
INDY
I rode with Pancho villa. A couple of his
guys spoke it.
 44. 10/15/07
MUTT
Bull-shit!
INDY
You asked.
MUTT
Pancho Villa?
INDY
Technically, I was kidnapped.
MUTT
By Pancho Villa?
INDY
It was the fight against Victoriano
Huerta.
Indy SPITS on the ground at the mention of Huertaís name.
MUTT
How old were you ?
INDY
ëbout your age.
MUTT
Your parents musta lost it, huh?.
INDY
thins were -- a little tense at home.
MUTT
Things are a little tense between me and
my mom right now.
INDY
Treat her right, kid, you only get one.
(muttered)
And sometimes not for long.
MUTT
It ainít my problem(my fault), itís
hers. She got P.O.ed cause I quit
school, like Iím some kind of goof or
cause I quit school.
INDY
You quit school?
 45. 
MUTT
Sure, tons of ëem. Fancy prep schools.
Teach you chess, debate, fencing: Iím
great with a blade. I just think itís a
waste of time.
 45A. 
INDY
You never finished?
MUTT
Nah, itís all useless skills and the
wrong books. I mean, I love reading, Ox
made me read all the time. Now I can pick
ëem myself, you get me.
INDY
What do you do for money?
MUTT
Fix motorcycles.
INDY
Plan on doing that forever?
MUTT
Maybe I will, teach. You got a problem
with that?
INDY
No, not if thatís what you love doing,
donít let anybody tell you any different.
As they head toward the hulking sanitarium at the end of the
street, the brim of a Panama hat rises in the foreground.
Somebodyís watching them. The head turns, and we get a good look
at him as Indy and Mutt walk away.
Itís Indyís old friend Mac.
CUT TO:
53 EXT SANITARIUM DAY
The looming facade of the sanitarium. Indy and Mutt walk toward
it, and Indy reads the words carved over the door.
INDY
Saint Anthony de Padua.(this is it)-
(here we are)
(sees the irony)
The patron saint of lost things.
 46. 
RETAKE 8-31-07 -A PERUVIAN NUN opens a gate, Indy and Mutt enter.
She speaks in Spanish, Indy translates, while Mutt trails them.
They head down the steps into a corridor in the sanitarium.
PERUVIAN NUN (IN SPANISH)
Ne se donde esta el, pero te voy a
mostrar la celda. Vinieron hombres
armados. Hombres malos y se lo llevaron.
(I donít know where he is, I will take
you to his cell. Armed men came. Bad men
and they took him) Estaba obsesionado
con la pintura, pintaba toda las paredes
al borde de la locura. ( he was obsessed
with painting, he painted all the walls,
he was crazy)
INDY
She says Ox, heís not here now(he isnít
here)Sheís going to show us the cell.
She doesnít know where he is(where he
want) some men came and took him away,
man with guns. She says Oxley was
obsessed, deranged, drew pictures all
over the wall of the cell.
Indy and the Nun continue down the corridor.
PERUVIAN NUN
Estaba obsesinado con la pintura.
Pintaba todas las paredes. Lo Dejo hasta
el borde de la locura.
INDY
She says he was obsessed, deranged, he
drew pictures all over the walls of his
cell.
MUTT looks into the cells, freaked out by the INMATES behind the
bars on either side of the stone hallway.
CARLOS
El sabia que se me pegaba.(he knew it was
sticking to me) y lo pique, lo pique, lo
pique( and I stabbed him, and stabbed him , and
stabbed him)
The Nun moves ahead to a certain cell and begins to open the
lock. Indy takes out Oxleyís letter. He and Mutt stand nearby .
 46A. 
INDY
This riddle of Oxleyís makes no
senseî...follow the lines only the gods can
read leads to Orellanaís cradle.î
Cradle? Cradle? birth, Orellana wasnít
born in Peru, he was born in Spain. He
was a Conquistador, he came here for
gold.
MUTT
What happened to him?
INDY
Disappeared along with six others. Their
bodies were never found.
The nun unlocks the door--
Indy and Mutt enter the cell.
 46B. 
54 INT SANITARIUM DAY
Indy and Mutt walk down an endless corridor in the sanitarium,
led by a PERUVIAN NUN.
She and Indy converse in whispered Spanish while Mutt trails
them, freaked out by the INMATES behind the bars on either side
of the stone hallway. SCRATCHY CLASSICAL MUSIC plays on an old
record player.
NUN
Este hombre ha pasado todo el limite de
la locura. Esta completamente
obsesionado. La obsesion fue tan grande.
que ha pasado el limite de la locura.
Esta completamente obsesionado de la
pintura. No Ha dejado una pared sin
pintar. Todo parece loco. Obsesionado
Hay Professor Jones esta completamente
transtornado. Ha pintado todas las
paredes. Es una obseion qui tiene con las
pinturas. La obsesion de este hombre
come esta transtornado no se puede
explicar. Su mente esta totalmente
transtornada. Esta obsesionado con las
pinturas en las paredes. A pintado de
dia y de noche. A dejado todo pintoado.
Indy takes out Oxleyís letter and reads it.
Suddenly one of the inmates lunges forward and grabs Mutt by the
jacket, he has his hands on Mutt, pulling him toward them until --
-- Indyís hand clamps down on Muttís jacket and pulls him free.
The Inmate yells , in Spanish, itís as if heís speaking in
tongues-- some clear some not.
INMATE
El venia pero you no podia v er y llegaba
la sangre. Acercaba. Agarre y lo picaba y
lo picaba y me quieria matar y lo picaba y
lo picaba. El caia ensima de mi.
The Nun moves quickly out of the way, Indy and Mutt follow her.
INDY
She says Oxley was deranged. Obsessed.
He drew pictures all over the walls of
his cell.
 47. 
INDY (contíd)
ì...follow the lines only the gods can
read... leads to Orellanaís
cradle.î(musing to himself)
MUTT
What?
INDY
ì...follow the lines only the gods can
read leads to Orellanaís cradle.î
Cradle? Makes no sense, Orellana wasnít
born in Peru, he was born in Spain. He
was a Conquistador, he came here looking
for gold.
MUTT
What happened to him?
INDY
Disappeared along with six others.
Their bodies were never found.
The nun stops at a certain cell, unlocks it --
55 INT CELL DAY
-- and swings the metal door wide open. Indy and Mutt step into
the room, which is about twenty feet square. Very spare, a cot, a
sink, two small windows, and a stone floor.
But what immediately catches their attention is the walls.
The lady wasnít kidding, Oxley was obsessed, and has indeed drawn
pictures on the stone walls of his cell.
Pictures of the Crystal Skull.
 47A. 10/17/07
Theyíre EVERYWHERE. Big versions, small ones, abstracts --
dozens and dozens of drawings of the skull, smothering the four
walls. The far wall is one great big drawing, and Ox has used
the small square windows for the skullís eyes.
MUTT
Ox, man, what happened to you?
Indy turns, notices the emotion on Muttís face. He watches him
for a moment, realizing the depth of his connection with Oxley.
Mutt notices Indy noticing and turns away, embarrassed.
Indy looks back to the drawings, studying them. In the profile
drawings, the back of the head is elongated.
INDY
This isnít anything like the MitchellHedges skull. Look at the cranium-- the
elongation.
Thereís something else written on the walls of the cell -- a
series of words, but not different words, theyíre:
INDY (contíd)
the same word, over and over, in
different languages.
Mutt finds one in Spanish and translates:
MUTT
ìReturn.î Return where?
INDY
Or ìwhat.î
 48. 
MUTT
You mean the skull?
Indy gestures to the drawings, makes the understatement of the
year.
INDY
Seemed to be on his mind.
MUTT
Where was he supposed to return it to?
He goes back down to his notes, studying the lines from the
letter that he transcribed.
Indy looks down. At the floor. He notices something. Drops to
his knees and runs his fingertips across the floor. He finds a
groove there, something scratched in the floor.
He traces along the line, finds another, and another, somebody
has carved lines into the soft stone floor!
56 BACK OUT IN THE HALLWAY,
Indy grabs a broom from the Janitorís cart.
57 BACK IN THE CELL,
BAM! The broom flies at Mutt, who catches it with one hand, right
in front of his face.
INDY
Sweep.
Indy goes to the far wall and starts to climb it, hoisting
himself up onto the window ledge, then climbing to the next
ledge, getting higher and higher.
When Indyís a good ten feet off the ground, he turns back,
looking at the area Mutt has swept clean.
INDY (contíd)
Ox didnít mean Orellanaís birthplacecradle means more than one thing in
Mayan, literally itís resting place, as
in ëfinalí resting place. He meant his
grave, and that ---drawing he scratched
into the floor
 49. 
Through the cloud of dust and dirt, we can see a drawingís been
carved into the floor of the cell, but this elaborate rendering
isnít a skull, it has the jagged peaks of burial temples and
gravestones.
INDY (contíd)
-- is the cemetery where heís buried.
MUTT
but you said Orellana vanished. Nobody
ever found his grave.
INDY
Looks like Harold Oxley did.
As we stare at this outline of a specific cemetery a FLASH OF
LIGHTNING --
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
 50. 
58 EXT CHAUCHILLA CEMETERY NIGHT
Mutt covers his motorcycle, in the moonlight. He is holding a *
backpack and a flashlight, he walks up the steps and joins Indy. *
Indy finds two shovels. *
A hand-painted sign on a gate CREAKS in the wind: *
MATAREMOS A LOS HUAQUEROS!
Mutt reads the sign: *
MUTT *
ìGrave robbers will be shot!î *
Indy grins. *
INDY *
Good thing weíre not grave robbers. *
He throws the one of the shovels to Mutt. *
Lightning CRACKS behind him. *
He turns and walks into the cemetery, as he goes through the *
archway. Mutt follows reluctantly. *
59 DEEPER IN THE CEMETERY, *
half the graves have been strip mined, pillaged over the years, *
revealing skeletons in bizarre burial postures. There are other *
skeletons strewn about, the place is in a state of disrepair. *
Two skeletons have been leaned up against grave markers, right *
out in the open. *
Itís dark, Indy and Mutt lit only by the moon and the flickering *
glow from the flashlight. Dirt and sand blow everywhere. As *
they march against the wind. They walk in deeper into the *
cemetery. *
Chauchilla Cemetery is on a cliffside, partially eroded from *
below, leaving a promontory. Itís nighttime, a thunderstorm *
blowing in. Lightning CRACKS, and in that flash we see the Nazca *
lines, lit up on the desert floor hundreds of feet below.. *
A SHADOWY FIGURE, which has blended into the branches, seems to *
materialize right out of the tree. Catlike in his grace but *
definitely human, he slinks across the tree branch, following *
Indy and Mutt into the cemetery. *
*
 50A. 
MUTT *
What are we looking for?
INDY
I donít know yet. Something that *
doesnít look right. Maybe an *
antechamber off one of these open *
barrows. *
One of the skeleton creatures moves out of a hole, and starts *
to follow them, he jumps into another hole and disappears. *
Mutt flinches, whirling around to look behind him. *
MUTT
Thought I saw somethiní. *
INDY *
Youíre jumping at shadows. *
Theyíve reached a cliff. Mutt drops his shovel into the opening, *
and gets on a ladder. *
MUTT *
This way down. *
As he is about to take a step down, the ladder disintegrates and *
he falls flat on his back. *
Indy looks at him for a beat, then he starts to climb down the *
steps. *
He reaches Mutt, and extends his hand. *
INDY *
This way up. *
Mutt takes his hand and gets up. *
 51. 
SLAM! *
Indy and Mutt are knocked to the ground by A SHADOW that drops out *
of the tree branches above. NITO kicks Indy down. Indy hits the *
wall and falls down a set of steps to a lower ground. Nito POUNDS
Mutt, and immediately disappears back into a hole.
Mutt falls backwards, and suddenly the lone skeleton, (ERNIE) *
comes out of the hole from behind and pounces on him! *
We see itís a real, living human being, dressed in a suit of bones *
to disguise itself.
Mutt whirls the figure around, they struggle. *
Indy reacts and gets up, he grabs the shovel and runs to Mutt. *
Mutt ducks at the last moment, Indy hits the creature with the *
shovel. *
The bones SHATTER, revealing a human face behind.
Before Indy can hit again, the figure slips away under Indyís *
legs and trips him. He runs into another hole. *
Mutt gets the shovel and CLICKS open his switchblade, he starts *
to go after the figure into the hole. He hears something and *
turns... *
NITO (the 2nd warrior)comes out of the hole with a blowdart gun, *
he raises it and aims at Mutt.. *
THWACK! *
A BLOWDART hits Muttís shovel handle. Mutt looks at it. Nito is *
about to fire again. *
Mutt takes his knife flips it in his hand and hurls it-- *
-- and it grazes the Warriorís shoulder, drawing blood, and *
throwing off his aim. The Warrior drops the blowgun, and takes *
the knife out from his wound. He starts to stand and cocks his *
arm to hurl it a Mutt, but -- *
--KUH-RACK! *
Indyís got his whip out. The lash wraps around Nitoís wrist and *
wrenches the knife free. It THUMPS to the dirt, Nito jumps down *
and runs into the same hole that Ernie went in. Indy sees that *
Mutt is alright and follows Nito into the hole. *
Mutt looks around frantically. He hits the skeleton next to him, *
still searches for anyone coming, suddenly he senses something *
and slowly turns to see: *
 52. 
Ernie comes out from one of the arches carrying the blowdart *
gun. He gets ready to shoot at Mutt. *
--Mutt winces, heís toast for sure-- *
-- but suddenly A HAND closes over the barrel of the blowgun --
-- INDYíS HAND! --
-- and he yanks the gun toward himself and BLOWS SAVAGELY into
the wrong end of the barrel.
The Warrior GASPS, his eyes go wide as the poison dart flies back
up the tube, JABS into the back of his throat, and kills him. *
Suddenly behind Mutt another WARRIOR, holding a bone, lunges *
toward him. Mutt is about ready to start the fight. *
-- Indy pulls his revolver, COCKS it -- *
-- and the Warrior changes his mind, scurrying up and out of the
grave and disappearing into the darkness.
Mutt has been watching with wide eyes. He looks up and sees Indy *
standing there, whip in one hand, gun in the other, LIGHTNING and
THUNDER CRACKING behind him.
MUTT
Youíre a teacher? *
INDY
Part-time. *
He UNCOCKS his gun. *
Mutt picks up his switchblade. He notices thereís a smear of *
blood on the blade. *
MUTT
I never really used it before. *
INDY
You did good kid. *
Indy strips the hat and burial serape from one of the skeletons, *
wraps the poncho around the dead warrior that just attacked them,
and shoves the hat down on his head. Sitting up against the wall
of the gave, he looks exactly like the other corpses.
 53. 
INDY (contíd)
That oughta keep him for a couple hundred
years.
Indy sees a lantern *
Indy and Mutt head down deeper into the cemetery. Mutt is *
carrying the lantern. *
MUTT
Who were those things?
INDY
Nazca Indians. *
(thinking)
Or their descendants. Sure didnít like *
us poking around.
(to himself)
What are(were) they protecting? *
They reach the bottom and enter into ..... *
 54. 
Theyíre at a dead end, a stone wall dotted with various niches *
with skulls and bones, covered in cobwebs. *
MUTT *
Dead end. *
INDY *
Maybe. *
Mutt takes out his comb and begins to comb his hair. Indy catches *
him. *
INDY (contíd) *
What are you doing? *
MUTT *
What? *
INDY *
Put that thing away. Give me some light *
over here. (bring it over here) *
Mutt moves closer to Indy. *
Indy looks down, sees a couple sets of dusty footprints leading
to and from the wall. One of the niches in the wall has a skull
wedged in, and as Indy bends down for a closer look, he sees the
cobwebs in the skullís nose and mouth are moving. *
As if the skull is breathing -- or blown by circulating air.
Indyís face lights up. He pulls the skull out by the eye sockets,
and sees a looped rope inside the niche.
He pulls on the rope and the rocks CREAK open, revealing a narrow
passageway.
Excited, Mutt lunges backwards -- *
And lands next to one of the skeletons, his arm on top the chest. *
-- and a dozen SCORPIONS stream out over his arms.
The biggest one raises its stinger and sinks it into Muttís *
right hand. *
MUTT
GAAAAH!
Indy starts to go through the opening. Mutt is jumping around , *
brushing himself, frantic, trying to get the scorpions away *
from him. *
 54A. 
INDY
Dance on our own dime, will ya. *
MUTT
Scorpions! One of ëem bit me! Iím gonna *
die! *
INDY
How big? *
MUTT
Huge!
INDY
Oh, good.
MUTT
GOOD?!
INDY
(turns back) When it comes to scorpions, *
the bigger the better.
(another thought) *
A small one bites you, donít keep it to *
yourself.
And heís gone, into the tunnel.
MUTT *
Iíll keep it to myself. *
INDY *
Címon. *
Mutt follows. *
CUT TO: *
*
 54B. 
61 INT TUNNEL NIGHT *
Indy starts to go down a set of stairs, Mutt follows. *
He gets startled -- he is facing a skeleton, buried upright in *
recess in the tunnel walls, their arms and legs bound across *
their chests, their dead eyes staring at him. *
Indy, who was ahead, turns back *
INDY *
Theyíre not going to bite you. Letís go. *
They continue down the stairs, Mutt looks at the skeletons. They *
reach the bottom, Mutt walks up to one of them, holding up the *
lantern up to the head. *
MUTT *
Their SKULLS! Look at their skulls man! *
Indy comes up next to him, he shines the flashlight on the head. *
The skull is bizarre. The back of the cranium is elongated, egg- *
shaped. *
INDY *
Like the drawings in Oxleyís cell. It *
means weíre getting closer. *
MUTT *
itís crazy. Whyís it like that?
INDY *
Nazca Indiana used to bind their infants *
head with rope to elongate their skull *
like that. *
MUTT *
Why? *
INDY *
Honor the gods. *
Indy moves towards another opening. *
MUTT *
No, no. Godís head is not like that, *
man. *
INDY *
Depends on who your god is. *
Indy enters the opening *
 55. 
INT. TUNNEL/MAYAN CALENDAR-DISC-NIGHT *
Indy enters the opening he crawls onto a large Mayan Calendar, he *
moves across. *
INDY *
Calendar, typical early Mayan. *
As he does the disc begins to tilt up covering Muttís view on the *
other end. Mutt is still holding onto the lantern in his left *
hand. *
MUTT *
This is(Youíre) going nowhere fast. *
Donít you think we should go the other *
way. Professor arenít we suppose to be *
looking for an exit. This is really a *
dead end. *
Indy reacts to the disc moving. He moves closer and looks out at *
the other opening. Indy, goes back to Mutt. The disc tilts down *
as he approaches Mutt opening the view. *
INDY *
Thatís it, címon genius. *
Indy starts to head back. *
INDY (contíd) *
Bring the backpack, címon. *
Mutt starts to follow Indy. *
MUTT *
Where are we going? *
 55A. 
INT. TUNNEL CRAWL SPACE-NIGHT *
Indy throws his backpack into the crawl space. He slides in, *
still carrying his flashlight. Mutt races to catch up to Indy in *
the narrow space. But as he scrambles forward on his hands an
knees, the floor buckles and his right hand, falls deep into a *
hole. *
He claws for a grip on the sides of the floor, he gets back up *
onto the firm ground. *
Indy hurries back. *
INDY *
You alright? *
Mutt nods. *
INDY (contíd) *
The earthís (grounds) eroded out from *
underneath us. Weíre on a promontory. *
Mutt, safe for the moment, catches his breath. *
MUTT
Thatís good to know. *
INDY *
Be careful. *
And heís gone again, crawling away into the tunnel, with his *
backpack. *
MUTT *
Be careful.(under his breath) *
He starts to follow Indy. *
Indy is staring out to the opening. Mutt comes up right next to *
him. Indy stops him. *
INDY *
Hold it. *
They listen, then move out. *
*
 55B. 
62 INT UNDERGROUND CHAMBER NIGHT
Indy clears away the cobwebs and heads in... *
The lantern light emerges form the darkness into an underground *
burial chamber. *
Indy comes out and looks around in awe. Mutt comes out of the *
tunnel behind him. *
INDY *
This is incredible. *
MUTT *
Unreal. *
Mutt starts to move forward, Indy puts out an arm to stop him *
from trampling the place.
INDY *
Donít touch anything. *
He waves the flashlight, exposing two sets of footprints in the *
dust. The footprints lead down the stairs and back out again. *
Indy and Mutt squat to get a closer look. *
INDY (contíd)
Somebodyís been here. Recently. *
(studying the prints)
Two sets. *
Mutt looks at the tracks, measure them with his hand.
MUTT
Same size. Could have been the same
person, twice.
INDY
(impressed)
Not bad, kid.
Indy walks down the stairs, trying to walk in the existing *
footprints. They lead to an object the size of a corpse, wrapped *
in a strange, material. Indy starts to count them. *
*
*
*
 56. 
 INDY (contíd) *
One...two...(turns and walks across the *
room)three (at a bottom one-lifts the *
flashlight up to) four... five... six... *
seven.
(gestures with the flashlight) *
Orellana and his men. Might have made it *
out of the jungle after all. *
Indy moves to one of the bodies and tries to open the material *
in which itís wrapped. He tugs at it -- he puts his flashlight *
away. *
INDY *
Got a knife? *
Mutt takes out his knife and flips it in his hand. He hands it to *
Indy. *
INDY (contíd) *
Give me the light. *
Indy starts to cut the body. He pulls the wrapping back, finds *
another layer underneath, and pulls that back too. Indy reveals *
the body of a SPANISH CONQUISTADOR, five hundred years old --
-- and perfectly preserved.
MUTT
It looks like he died yesterday.
Indeed it does -- his body is intact, his clothes, his weapons,
even his skin.
INDY
Itís the wrappings, theyíve preserved *
him.
The face begins to withered away to DUST! It shrivels and rots, *
and within ten seconds itís a pile of dust. *
Indy and Mutt are amazed. *
MUTT *
What just happened? *
INDY *
Itís been wrapped up for 500 years. Air *
doesnít agree with him. *
*
 57. 
Indy reaches inside the body. *
He pulls free a solid gold dagger with a jewel encrusted handle *
and holds it up to the lantern light, admiring it. Indy hands *
Mutt his switchblade back. *
Indy starts to put the dagger in his satchel but-- *
MUTT *
Hey! *
INDY *
I was going to put it back. I donít want *
to keep borrowing yours all the time. *
MUTT
Uh huh.
Indy returns the dagger -- *
Mutt moves to the other side of the crypt. *
MUTT (contíd) *
is this one open already? *
Indy joins Mutt. The cocoon is torn open. *
There is a golden mask over the face of this corpse. *
INDY *
Itís him! Itís Orellana himself. *
*
*
 57A. 
Indy gestures to the skeleton, festooned with gilded armor. *
INDY (contíd) *
they called him, the gilded Man. What an *
incredible find. *
He stops himself, furrows his brow. Somethingís not right. He *
points to the mask over Orellanaís face. *
Indy reaches out to the mask, runs his hand along the edges. *
He closes his fingers around the mask and pulls it away slowly, *
revealing the skull of Orellana himself, contorted in a horrible *
death shriek. *
INDY (contíd) *
His lust for gold was legendary. This is *
odd.. *
Indy crosses to the other side of Orellana, and squats by his *
side. He picks some gold coins off the floor, studies the *
impressions. *
INDY (contíd) *
Somebody already has been here and gone. *
Left all this gold and (all)these *
artifacts. What were they looking (Indy *
starts to get up) *
The coins are pulled by a magnetic force. They get stuck to *
Orellanaís body. *
INDY (contíd) *
For.... *
Indy goes to the body, reaches down and lifts Orellanaís head *
and torso. He hands it to Mutt. *
INDY (contíd) *
Hold this. *
Mutt is eye to eye with the screaming, dead face. *
Indy looks beneath where the corpse was lying. He reaches down *
and carefully lifts the a skull away from the corpse. *
MUTT puts the skeleton down. *
 58. 
---- THE CRYSTAL SKULL OF AKATOR. *
Stunning. It was, indeed, cut form one piece of pure crystal, *
and is completely transparent, yet multi-faceted. . *
Indy holds the Crystal Skull up to the lantern. The light prisms *
through it, especially the eyes -- theyíre lensed, the light *
focusing through the sockets in a penetrating gaze. There *
appears to be a second crystal, embedded in the brain cavity, *
opal in color, standing out against the skullís bluish tint. *
INDY (contíd) *
Unbelievable. No tool marks... A single *
piece of seamless quartz. *
A coin gets stuck to the skull. Indy removes it. *
INDY (contíd) *
Cut across the grain, no evidence of a *
lapidary wheel. Itís not possible, even *
with todayís technology. It would *
shatter. What is this thing? *
As Indy turns the skull, Muttís eyes widen in surprise, because *
the back of the skullís head is egg-shaped, like the corpses *
outside. *
MUTT *
Look at he shape of the head. Maybe to *
the Nazca Indians...this was their god. *
Is this the one from... *
INDY *
Akator. (Indy begins to pace)Maybe the *
Spaniards find the skull along with all *
this other booty. They head to their *
ships along the coast. Maybe the Indians *
catch up with them, where they get to *
squabbling amongst themselves. The *
Indians wrap íem up and buried them here. *
*
 59. 
Indy looks at the skull, then down at the footprints again,
thinking aloud, piecing it together. *
INDY (contíd) *
Couple(500 centuries) hundred years *
later Oxley shows up, finds the skull, *
takes it away, maybe to Akator. Then he *
returns it here. *
MUTT *
ìReturn, return.î Like he wrote on the *
walls of his cell. *
INDY *
He put it back where he found it. Why?
Muttís switchblade flies out of his hand and CLINKS up against *
the skull, pulled by the metalís magnetic force. *
INDY (contíd) *
Crystal is not magnetic. *
MUTT
Neither is gold. *
Indy looks back at the skull, staring deeply into its eyes.
INDY *
What is this thing?
He gazes deeper, and deeper, and the skull seems to glow in
response, or is it just reflecting light from the lantern?
Indyís eyes grow wider, heís transfixed, and it doesnít seem he
could possibly tear his eyes away from the thing.
Even Mutt has noticed the hypnotic quality of the skull, and he
steps forward to look at it, now right behind Indy --
-- and the floor beneath them gives way!
Mutt falls, but grabs hold of the leg of Orellanaís skeleton as *
he goes down, through the floor -- *

UNIFORMED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS on either side. *
Mac, Indyís old friend, walks up to him. *

68 EXT IQUITOS NIGHT
Night has fallen on the outskirts of the jungle city of Iquitos,
the last toehold of civilization before the Amazon. A SOVIET
ARMY REGIMENT is amassed in a makeshift camp on the edge of the
clawing jungle.
There are a dozen vehicles -- jeeps, trucks, one great big
machine with a series of horizontal saw blades on the front, and
FIFTY RED ARMY SOLDIERS.
The Russians are a celebratory bunch, some of them grouped around
a bonfire where a CRAZY RUSSIAN dances wildly.
A small tent glows at the center of the camp, lit up by the
lantern-light within. There are TWO GUARDS at the flap.
69 INT TENT NIGHT
Inside the tent, Indy is sitting in a chair to which he has been *
tied. Dovchenko is watching the tent. *
 62. 10/15/07
Mac enters, holding a bottle of liquor in one hand and a cigar *
in the other. He walks up to Indy, smiling his most winning *
smile.
MUTT *
Youíre lucky I turned up Jonesey. *
Dovchenko wanted to blow your brains out *
Thatís the three times Iíve saved your *
life, mate. *
INDY
Unshackle me and Iíll give you a big *
hug. *
MAC
You had a Luger pointed at the base of
your skull when we first met. *
INDY *
I had the situation under control. *
MAC *
Do you remember the amnesia darts I *
pulled out of your neck in Jakarta?
INDY *
Amnesia darts?
MAC
See, you donít remember! Take my word
for it, you owe me.
Mac sits down, where a reel-to-reel tape recorder is turning on a *
table, recording every word. *
INDY *
What about them? What do you owe them? *
After the war, when you turned -- how *
many names did you give the Reds? How *
many good men died because of you? *
MAC *
I donít think you see the big picture, *
mate. *
INDY *
Eventually theyíre going to let me out of *
this chair, comrade, and when they do Iím *
going to (bust)break your nose. *
Mac puts the bottle down and picks up the microphone. *
 63. 
MAC
ìComrade?î You think this is about *
flags? This is about uniforms? Itís *
about lines on a map? *
INDY
itís just about money, isnít it? *
 63A. 
MAC
No, not ìonly money,î (he drops the *
microphone gets up and goes to Indy))a *
gigantic pile of money! Donít worry *
about what the Russians will pay us, *
itís nothing compared to whatís at
Akator. An entire city of gold, itís *
what the Conquistadors were after *
(looking, searching), for Dogís sake *
Jonesey! We could be richer, richer *
than Howard Hughes.
INDY *
Blood money. Every nickle of it. *
Mac leans in and lowers his voice. Itís stilted, as if Macís *
trying to tell Indy something.
MAC *
I need you to see the angle here, mate, *
to be smart and do the right thing. Like *
in- *
Before he can finish, the lantern light flickers as someone
pushes open the tent flap, letting in a breeze from outside. A
shadow falls across them both.
Indy looks up. Irina Spalko stands behind Mac, dressed in
Russian military fatigues. *
Mac doesnít need to turn around, he knows perfectly well who it
is. He finishes what he was saying to Indy, voice low --
MAC (contíd)
Like in Berlin. Get me? Just like *
Berlin. *
Mac heads out and walks past Spalko and Dovchenko. *
MAC (contíd) *
You want me to jiggle out of here, or *
should I sing a song. Paddling Madeline. *
(he starts to sing) I love this girl *
called Madeline. I know she loves me *
too, cause every night the moon shines *
bright she rides in my canoe at *
midnight. *
-- and beats it out of the tent. Spalko sizes up Indy.
 64. 
SPALKO
How fortunate our failure to kill you,
Dr. Jones. You survive to be of service
to us once again. *
She walks towards the recorder *
INDY
You know me, anything I can do to help.
SPALKO
ìNow I am become Death, the Destroyer of
Worlds.î You recognize those words? It
was your own Dr. Oppenheimer, after he
created the atomic bomb.
She turns off one of the switches and continues to move around *
Indy. *
INDY
He was quoting the Hindu Bible.
EXT. TENT-NIGHT *
Mac steps near the fire still singing his song(Paddling Madeline *
Home) *
MAC *
I love this girl called Madelin. I know *
she loves me too cause every night the *
moon shines bright she rides in my canoe *
at midnight. *
He is no longer drunk, he looks back at Indyís tent. *
 64A. 
SPALKO
It was nuclear intimidation. But now
this next level of weapon is ours to have
-- yours to fear.
INDY
Weapon? What weapon?
Spalko moves to the front and faces Indy, she leans on the chair *
with her leg. *
SPALKO
A mind weapon. A new frontier of psychic *
warfare; that was Stalinís dream. *
Indy looks at her like sheís nuts.
INDY *
Now I know why Oxley put the skull back *
where he found it. He knows you were *
after it. *
SPALKO *
That skull is no mere deity carving. *
Surely you knew the moment you laid eyes *
on it -- it was not made by human hands.
She leans forward and puts her hands on Indyís legs. *
INDY
Who made it then? *
(off her look)
Címon. *
She looks across the tent and moves. *
SPALKO *
that body we found in New Mexico was not *
the first. *
Spalko walks across the tent into a side tent. There is a body *
covered on a table. She starts to clean her hands with a cloth. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
Weíd already dissected two others from *
similar crash sites in Soviet Union. *
INDY *
Saucer-men from Mars? *
 65. 
SPALKO *
The legends about Akator are all true. *
Early man couldnít have conceived it,
much less built it. It was a city of
supreme beings, with technologies and *
paranormal abilities. *
She moves to the head of the table, Dovchenko standing next to *
her with a flashlight. *
INDY
You gotta be kidding me. *
SPALKO
Why do you disbelief your own eyes.(Why *
Do you choose not to believe your own *
eyes? *
She uncovers the body and reveals the alien form. Spalko moves *
the head and opens the brain,exposing the crystal skull. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
The New Mexico specimen gave us hope. *
Unlike the others weíd found, (this)its *
skeleton was pure crystal. A distant *
cousin, perhaps? Maybe they too were *
sent to find Akator. Perhaps weíre all *
searching for the same thing. Thereís no *
other explanations *
INDY *
Thereís always another explanation. *
Spalko washes her hands. *
SPALKO *
The skull was stolen from Akator in the *
15th century. *
She walks back to Indyís tent. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
Whoever returns it -- *
 65A. 
INDY *
--to the cityís temple will gain control *
over its power. Iíve heard that bedtime *
story before. What makes you think *
Akator even exists. (But what if Akator *
never existed)(Itís a legend why do you *
think Akator even existed) *
SPALKO *
Perhaps you should ask your friend that *
question. *
DOVCHENKO *
PRIRIDITYE PROFESSORA!(bring in the *
professor) *
SPALKO *
Weíre certain heís been there. *
INDY *
Oxley. Where is he? *

 65B. 
70 EXT- RUSSIAN CAMP NIGHT *
The Crazy Guy is still dancing around it like a madman. Heís *
dressed in an old, battered suit, the arms and legs shredded.
His hair is long and wild, and heís flinging his body around the
campfire with mad abandon while the Russians laugh and clap,
mocking him.
A couple of he soldiers approach Oxley, grab him and take him to *
the tent. *
INT. TENT-NIGHT *
PROFESSOR HAROLD OXLEY looks nothing like the conservative
archeology professor we saw in the photo. Heís got wild, redrimmed eyes, his cheeks are sunken and his clothes hang from his
skeletal form. He starts to dance with a musical pole. *
INDY *
Ox? Ox! Itís me, Indy. *
(ox)Youíre faking it, right pal? *
Oxley wonít even look at Indy. His eyes are wild, they never
rest, never make eye contact. Oxley dances towards Indy. *
OXLEY
Through eyes that last I saw in tears...
Indy pulls Oxley close, lowers his voice. *
INDY
(Ox)Listen to me pal, your name is *
Harold Oxley, you were born in Leeds, *
England. You and I went to school *
together at the University of Chicago,
and you were never this interesting! My *
name is Indi- *
(though it pains him) *
My name is Henry Jones Junior. *
But Oxley just spins away and heís off again, dancing around him *
and, MUTTERING unintelligibly. Indy whirls on Mac and Spalko. *
INDY (contíd) *
What have you done to him?! *
MAC *
We ainít done a thing, itís the bloody *
skull. *
 66. 
SPALKO *
He is a divining nod that will lead us to *
Akator. But we need someone to interpret *
him for us. His mind, it seems, is *
quite weak. Letís hope yours is *
stronger. *
CUT TO: *
 66A. 
71 INT LARGER TENT NIGHT *
Dovchenko catches Indyís hat. Spalko moves to a table, Indyís *
backpack is resting on it. *
Spalko opens the backpack and pulls the CRYSTAL SKULL, she takes *
it in her arms and walks towards Indy. The lamps all move *
towards the skull. *
Indy is in the chair still strapped, he is now wearing a strap *
across his head, attached to electrodes to his temples and *
frontal lobe. *
SPALKO *
The skullís crystal stimulates an *
undeveloped part of the human brain, *
opening a psychic channel. *
*
 67. 
Spalko turns the skull to face Indy. The lensed eye sockets *
catch the light and glow intensely. Spalko sits it down facing *
Indy.
SPALKO (contíd) *
Oxley lost control of his mind by staring *
too long into its eyes. *
Spalko walk to Indy. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
We believe you can get through to him *
after yo have done the same. *
She puts a hand on Indyís cheek, stroking it, trying gently to *
turn him toward the skull. *
INDY
I got a better idea. You look at it. *
SPALKO *
The skull does not speak to everyone, it *
seems. *
Spalko walks back to the skull.
SPALKO (contíd) *
Surely youíre not afraid, Dr. Jones? *
Youíve spent your entire life searching *
for answer, think of the truth behind *
those eyes. *
She puts her hands around the skull. *
Spalko walks to the side of the tent. *
There is a Scientist seated at a table with a EEG monitor, she *
walks up to the table. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
there maybe be hundreds of these skulls *
at Akator, perhaps thousands. Whoever *
finds them will control the greatest *
natural force the world has ever known. *
(she picks up a stopwatch-and turns to *
Indy) Power over the mind of man. *
INDY *
Be careful. You might get exactly what *
you ask for. *
SPALKO *
I usually do. *
 68. 
Spalko starts her stopwatch. *
Indy smiles. *
A strange pulsing emanates from the center of the skull, brighter *
in its eyes. Indy canít help it, heís drawn to it -- *
Indy looks deeply into the skullís eyes. Immediately, the needles *
on the EEG graph spike. *
The light in the eyes of the skull grows brighter and Indyís *
stare more intense. The EEG readings increase in density. *
Spalko takes note. *
 68A. 
SPALKO (contíd)
Imagine -- to peer across the world and
know the enemyís secrets. To place our
thoughts in the minds of your leaders -- *
(she moves towards Indy)-- make your *
teachers teach the true version of
history, your soldiers attack on our *
orders. *
Indy couldnít look away from the skull now if he wanted to. *
Spalko walks around Indy. *
SPALKO (contíd)
Weíll be everywhere at once, as powerful
as a whisper, invading your dreams, *
thinking your thoughts for you while you
sleep. *
Spalko walks back to the stand where the skull is. *
The veins in Indyís temples swell; his heartbeatís visible in *
them. He canít speak, heís caught in the gaze of the skull. *
The EEG needle is going batshit now, jumping all over the place, *
scribbling a line so dense itís almost one solid block of ink on *
the paper. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
we will change you, Dr. Jones, all of *
you, from the inside. We will turn YOU *
into US. *
Indyís face is trembling now, red and flushed, and bright red *
capillaries pop out in the whites of his eyes. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
and the best part? You wonít even know *
itís happening. *
Indy still stares into the skullís eyes, and he starts to mutter
now, directly to the skull.
INDY
Return.
 69. 
72 EXT BY THE CAMPFIRE NIGHT
And just as Indy says the word ìreturn,î we cut abruptly out to
the campfire, where Oxley is sitting by the campfire, as if *
hearing the word from Indyís lips, but of course heís too far
away. But he repeats it:
OXLEY
Return.
73 OMITTED *
74 EXT BY THE CAMPFIRE NIGHT
And Oxley continues to stare out. *
OXLEY *
Henry? *
 69A. 
75 INT TENT NIGHT *
Back in the tent, the veins in Indyís temples throb. Mac steps
forward. *
MAC
Thatís enough! For Godís sake if he *
dies we canít get there! *
Just when it seems Indy canít take anymore --
SPALKO
Cover it. *
She stops the stopwatch. *
Dovchenko darts in and pull a hood over the skull, breaking *
Indyís gaze. Mac gets close to Indy and study his blank *
expression.
MAC
Jonesey, you alright? *
Indy looks up at him. His eyes focus and he shakes his head, his *
mind clearing.
Mac unties Indyís arm. The second Indyís arm is free -- *
-- HE PUNCHES MAC IN THE FACE.
MAC (contíd) *
You broke my nose!
INDY
I Told you. *
Indy takes off the head gear, Dovchenko grabs Indy and pulls him *
away. Spalko steps up to him, eye to eye.
SPALKO
Enough. You will speak to Oxley and
lead us to Akator. Yes?
INDY
Nyet.
Expecting that response, she immediately BARKS an order. *
SPALKO *
Take him outside. *
Two soldiers leapt to attention and -- *
 70. 
76 EXT RUSSIAN CAMP NIGHT *
Spalko comes out of the tent, followed by Dovchenko ,and Indy-- *
Dovchenko throws Indy his hat.. they drag Mutt out of a nearby *
tent. They shove him roughly up alongside Indy. *
INDY
You alright, kid? *
MUTT
They left my bike in that cemetery!
INDY
(you donít understand)
Yeah but are you alright? *
MUTT
(you donít understand)
They left my bike!
One of the Russian Soldiers holds a polished cherry wood case,
two feet wide, four feet long, with a molded velvet interior. In *
the case there are several sabers and foils. *
She selects a wicked-looking one and approaches Mutt with it,
clearly a threat.
MUTT (contíd)
Wait! Donít! Stop! *
Geez, the kid panics easily. But Mutt fools us -- he pulls his
comb from his back pocket and runs it through his hair, gets it
just right. And then, to Spalko, utterly fearless:
MUTT (contíd)
Iím ready. *
(to Indy)
donít give these pigs a thing.
Indy smiles. Gotta love the kidís attitude. He looks back at
Spalko defiantly.
INDY
You heard him.
SPALKO
Clearly, I have chosen the wrong pressure
point.
 71. 
SPALKO (contíd)
Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one.
(to two Soldiers)
Privedite zhenshchinu!(bring in the *
woman) *
 71A. 
We hear the soldiers grab hold of someone uncooperative, in a *
nearby tent. We hear her VOICE before we see her. *
VOICE (O.S.)
Get your hands off me, you rotten
Russkie son of a bitch- *
Indyís eyes widen, he recognizes that voice, and the soldiers
reappear, dragging their struggling captive along with them.
Sheís in her late forties, sheís a knockout, and sheís smarter
than you. She used to be the girl next door you had a crush on;
now sheís the woman next door youíve always been in love with.
Sheís MARION RAVENWOOD.
INDY
Marion!
MARION
Indiana Jones. ëBout time you showed up. *
Indy walks to Marion. *
MUTT
Mom!
Marion noticing Mutt for the first time, walks past Indy towards *
Mutt. *
INDY *
Mom? *
MARION
Sweetheart! What are you doing here? *
MUTT
(to Marion)
forget about me, are you all right?
INDY
(to Mutt)
Mom *
MARION
I specifically told you -- *
INDY
(to Marion)
Marion is your-- mother? *
MARION
-- not to come down here yourself!
 72. 
MUTT *
You never wrote in your letter...phone *
calls.... *
 72A. 
INDY
Marion Ravenwood is your mother?
MARION
For Godís sake, Indy, itís not that hard.
INDY
Yeah, I know I just, I never thought *
that - *
MARION
That I have a life after you left? *
INDY
Thatís not what I meant- *
MARION
A damn good life. *
INDY
Well Thatís good(nice)(Iím glad), I just- *
MARION
A damn good life.(a damn good really *
good damn life)(a damn good, great, good *
life) *
INDY
So have I. *
MARION
Yeah? Still leaving a trail of human *
wreckage, or have you retired? *
INDY
Why, are you looking for a date? *
MARION *
With anyone(anybody) but you. *
INDY *
What are you mad at me for? (why are you *
so mad at me? ) *
MARION *
How much time have you got? *
Spalko joins them. *
*
*
 73. 
SPALKO *
So, Dr. Jones. You will help us? A *
simple yes will do.
INDY
Aw, Marion. You had to go and get
yourself kidnapped.
MARION
Not like you did any better.
INDY
Same old same old.
Indy notices Mac is staring at Marion approvingly. *
INDY (contíd) *
What are you looking at? *
CUT TO:
77 EXT BY THE CAMPFIRE NIGHT
Harold Oxley sits, staring off into the distance intently. *
Mac is standing nearby, he turns to the Russians with him he e *
lowers his voice. *
MAC
Iím giving three to one the Yank figures
him out. Who wants some. *
The Russian nods, takes the bet. Mac takes money out of his *
pocket. *
Indy sits across from Oxley, whoís staring at him openly now, his *
entire face lit up in a smile, as if heís seeing Indy for the
first time.
OXLEY
Henry Jones Junior! Henry Jones Junior! *
Indy looks at him, amazed. It worked.
Spalko presses forward to hear, she is right next to Indy. *
INDY
Thatís right, Ox. Thatís right, Ox. Now *
listen to me- *
*
 74. 
He grabs Indy, intently, trying to communicate something.
 74A. 
OXLEY *
ìTo lay their just hands on that Golden
Key... That opeís the Palace of
Eternity.î
INDY
The palace of -- ?
Spalko steps in.
SPALKO
Itís from Milton, heís said it before. *
Why? *
Indy has no idea. He looks back at Oxley, notices his right hand
is tremoring, as if with palsy.
INDY
ox. I you gotta tell us how to get to
Akator, or they're going to kill Marion. *
OXLEY
ìThrough eyes that last I saw in
tears... here in deathís dream
kingdom...î
Indy reaches out to still Oxleyís twitching right hand.
INDY
Harold theyíre gonna kill Abnerís little *
girl,! You remember Abner, donít you? *
Oxley urgency grows, heís trying to get through but canít.
OXLEY
ìeyes! That last I saw in- tears-î *
INDY
(getting frustrated)
You gotta tell us how we get there(to *
Akator) I need specifics. *
Indy notices Oxleyís right hand is moving faster now, detailed
motions not just tremors. And his fingers are pinched together,
as if holding something.
INDY (CONTíD)
(to the Russians)
Yeah, get me paper and something to *
write with.! *
MAC *
Get some paper. *
 75. 
MUTT *
Paper... *
A MOMENT LATER,
 75A. 
A notebook is hurriedly passed to Indy, who flips it open to a
blank page. He takes Oxleyís right hand and clamps the pen
between his friendís fingers, then shoves the paper under it.
And Oxley starts writing. Heís drawing something, a picture, and *
itís detailed. *
SPALKO *
Heís auto-writing. Of course, I should *
have seen this. *
OXLEY
(still staring at Indy)
Henry Jones Junior! *
But heís not looking at the paper, heís staring at Indy the whole
time.
INDY *
Thatís right Ox. *
OXLEY *
(confidentially, to Indy)
three times it drops.
INDY *
Three times. *
Indy looks at the page. Oxleyís drawn a crude sketch of ocean
waves. Oxleyís writing continues -- this time itís a pair of *
closed eyes.
Spalko and the others press in closely, to take a look. Spalko
looks at Indy admiringly. *
Oxley's not slowing down. Three more sketches -- the sun with an *
arc across a sky, a snake with a flicking tongue, and what looks
like a horizon.
SPALKO *
Pictographs? *
INDY
Ideograms! Keep going Ox.
Indy takes the book from Oxley, stands and walks to the fire pit, *
Spalko joins him. *
 76. 
Mutt comes forward to Oxley, he sits across from him. He tries to *
look him in the eye. *
MUTT *
Ox? *
But Oxley wonít look at hi, might not even be aware that heís *
there. Certainly doesnít recognize him, his eyes darting all over *
the place. *
MUTT (contíd) *
Címon, Ox, itís me. Itís Mutt. *
But Oxley wonít. Or canít. There are tears in Muttís eyes. *
MUTT (contíd) *
Please? *
Indy looks at the sketches, decoding them as he speaks *
*
 76A. 
INDY *
I think I got it. The wavy lines, means *
of course water, a closed eye means *
sleep -- the sun with the arc over the *
sky stands for ìtime,î duration, the *
word now is ìuntil.î The horizon and *
the snake theyíre close together, means *
one thought (the horizon and the snake *
means one thought, theyíre close *
together) -- the horizon (stood for)was *
the world, but it didnít mean the earth,
it meant big, ìgreat.î
Indy thinks like crazy, looking at the page back and forth. *
INDY (contíd)
ìthe water sleeps, until the Great
Snake.î These arenít just drawings,
theyíre directions.
(to a Russian)
Give me a map! *
Spalko gives the order in Russian. *
78 MOMENTS LATER
A table is brought out and a map of the Amazon is unfurled. As *
Indy bends over the map, Mac collects a wad of cash from the
Russian Soldier he made the bet with.
INDY (O.S.)
The Great snake is the Amazon,of course *
but ìsleeps,î what river sleeps?
Indy studies the map for a name, a clue, something, then stops
suddenly and jabs his finger down.
SPALKO *
Here. The Sono. The Portuguese word
for sleep.
Everyone bends down to see, and Mac presses in close beside
Marion. *
Indy bends over the map, fascinated now.
INDY
Yes! Good, exactly, very good! *
*
*
 77. 
Mutt watches Indy and Spalko studying the map together. *
INDY (contíd) *
He wants us to follow this curve of the *
Sono down to where it meets the Amazon, *
on the southeast. After that, Iím not *
sure. a dream kingdom, eyes in tears -- *
I have no idea know what he means. *
Mutt, whoís been peering slides further forward, as Indy studies *
the map.
INDY (contíd)
But his route could be right, itís a
completely unexplored part of the canopy.
Spalko bends down closer to the map --
INDY (contíd)
See, the mapmaker only sketched in a few
rough lines- *
-- AND MUTT Punches one of the soldiers and OVERTURNS THE TABLE. *
It hits Spalko in the face, knocking her and Dovchenko back on
their asses.
MUTT
RUN!
Mutt heads towards the tent. Indy has no choice but to follow *
Marion, Oxley and Indy all go into the tent. *
The group runs away, Mutt comes back and grabs one of the lamps *
and throws it on the ground. A fire starts, stopping Spalko and *
the solders from coming through. *
*
 78. 
79 EXT JUNGLE DAWN *
Mutt, Marion, Indy, and Oxley race through the jungle as the sun
rises, the foliage slapping and cutting at them.
INDY
KID? WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING, KID?!
MUTT
They were gonna kill us!
INDY
Well, maybe!
MUTT
Somebody had to do something!
INDY
Something else would have been good!
MUTT
At least I got a plan! Letís go!
 78A. 10/16/07
INDY
This is intolerable!
Oxleyís looking back over his shoulder, trying to watch the skull
as he moves further away from it, reaching out for it.
INDY (contíd)
Harold, for Godís sake, keep up!
Mutt turns sharply and leads them down a narrow ravine, through a
thick copse of trees, and into a tiny clearing.
They stand there, safe for a moment, trying not to make a sound
as the Russian Soldiers race past them, deeper into the jungle.
Mutt and Oxley stand at the edge of the trees, peering through,
and Indy and Marion are behind them.
MUTT
Shhh!-- *
He stops. Indy and Marion are gone.
Actually, theyíre not gone, theyíre just two feet lower than they
were the last time he saw them.
And theyíre up to their knees in sand.
MUTT (contíd)
Mom?
He takes a step forward, but --
INDY
Stop!
MARION
Keep back!
Mutt stops where he is, confused. And Indy and Marion sink even
lower, now up to their thighs.
INDY
Donít move, honey! Moving makes space, *
space will make you sink! *
MARION
(pulling hard at her leg)
I think I can get -- out if --
INDY
STOP IT! Youíre pulling against a
vacuum, itís like trying to lift a car!
Just stay calm!
 79. 10/16/07
MARION
Okay, Iím calm.
(sinking) *
MUTT
What is it, quicksand?!
INDY
(thereís always time to teach)
Itís a dry sandpit. *
MARION *
Iím calm. Iím sinking, but Iím calm. *
INDY *
Quicksand is a viscous mix of mud, clay, *
and water,(sand, clay and water) and *
depending of the fluidity itís not as *
dangerous as you mightMARION *
(thrashing again)
JONES FOR PETEíS SAKE, WEíRE NOT IN
SCHOOL!
INDY
youíre right! Stay calm! Thereís nothing *
to worry about, unless thereís aKA-PHOOM!!
A huge geyser of sand suddenly spits up between them, ten feet
into the air, and in the resulting settling of the pit, Indy and
Marion sink all the way up to their chests.
INDY (contíd)
Void collapse.
MUTT
Iíll get something to pull you out!
INDY *
Keep your arms up high. *
He looks around, canít find anything handy, and moves off into
the jungle, frantic. But Oxley only stares at them, bemused.
*
*
 80. 10/16/07
INDY *
Ox, donít just stand there, go, get *
help!
OXLEY *
ìHelp.î
INDY *
Help. *
OXLEY *
Help. *
INDY *
Help *
OXLEY *
Help. *
INDY *
Yes, go. *
OXLEY *
Help. *
And without another word, he turns and walks away. Indy and
Marion are alone, up to their chests in sand. Marion looks at
him, feeling responsible.
MARION
Mutt can be a little impetuous.
 80A. 10/16/07
INDY
Not the worst quality in the worKA-PHOOM!
Another geyser of sand erupts between them, and they drop
further, up to their necks now. Their arms are starting to slip
beneath the surface of the sand, and they try valiantly to keep
them up. But theyíre dropping deeper by the second.
They speak, but the constriction from the sandpit pressing in on
their chests makes it hard to find breath.
INDY (contíd)
... keep you ... arms above surface...
the kid comes back, grab on...
Marion turns and looks at him, her eyes filling with tenderness.
MARION
... Indy, his...
INDY
... heís a good kid, Marion... you *
should get off his back about school...
MARION
... Mutt, I mean...
INDY
... not everybodyís... cut out for it...
MARION
... his... his name is Henry.
And even through heís up to his neck in a deadly dray sandpit, Indy *
manages to turn his head to Marion and look into her eyes.
INDY
Henry? Good name. *
MARION
Heís your son. *
INDY
My son?
MARION
Henry Jones, the third.
Indy looks away, thinking, all the repercussions sinking in --
 and then he turns back to Marion furious
 81. 10/16/07
INDY
Why the HELL didnít you make him finish
school?!
Before she can answer, something long and heavy comes WHIZZING
through the air and SMACKS into the sand between them.
Mutt stands at the edge of the pit, holding the other end of
whatever it is, but itís dark and we canít tell.
MUTT
MOM! GRAB ON! *
Marion, who is slightly ahead of Indy, throws her arms over the
think, roundish shape.
Indy, slightly deeper in the sand, wrenches his arms free and
reaches for the end of the thing --
-- when it turns and HISSES at him. The ìthingî is very long,
very thick SNAKE.
INDY
Are you crazy?!
MARION
Just grab on, Indy!
INDY
Itís a SNAKE!
MUTT
Itís a rat snake! *
INDY
Rat snakes arenít that big!
MUTT
Well, this one is! Itís not poisonous! *
Now just grab on! *
INDY
Go get something else!
MUTT
LIKE WHAT?!
INDY
some rope or something!
MUTT
THEREíS NO SEARS AND ROEBUCK HERE, JUST *
GRAB A HOLD!
 82. 10/16/07
INDY
Maybe I can touch the bottom!
MARION
There is no bottom, now grab it!
INDY
I think I can feel it with my feet!
MUTT *
Grab the snake *
INDY *
Stop calling it that! *
MUTT *
What do you want me to call it? Itís a *
snake, grab it! *
INDY *
Say rope! *
MUTT *
What? *
INDY *
Say grab the rope!!! *
They look at each other. *
MARION & MUTT *
Grab the rope!!! *
finally, Indy relents, reaches out, closes his eyes, and grabs
hold of the snake, just as --
-- KA-PHOOM!!
The biggest sand geyser of all erupts in the pit, and in the
momentary space created around them, Mutt pulls as hard as he can
on the other end of the black snake.
Indy and Marion are released from the pit and go flying to its
edge, collapsing in a heap on top of Mutt, arms and legs
entangled. *
INDY *
Get rid of that, son. *
MUTT *
You are one crazy old man. Afraid of *
snakes! *
 83. 10/16/07
TWO PAIRS OF BLACK BOOTS step into frame. Harold Oxley is *
standing between Spalko, Mac, and two Russian Soldiers.
MAC
(sadly)
Why do you wanna do everything the hard
way, Jonesy? *
But Oxleyís proud. *
INDY
Nice, work Ox. thanks. *
OXLEY *
ìHelp!î *
CUT TO: *
 83A. 10/16/07
80 OMITTED *
81 OMITTED *
 84. 10/16/07
82 IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK,
The Crystal Skull is now in a burlap bag, cinched at the top. *
Irina Spalko opens the bag and pulls it down, revealing the eyes *
of the skull. She bends down in front of it and focuses her
bright blue eyes on its crystal sockets.
But it has no reaction. No glow. No nothing.
Oxley, sitting in the back of the truck, muttering to himself, *
watching the light dance through the trees.
She turns back to the skull, desperate. Why him and not me? She
lays her hands on either side of its face, leans even closer.
but nothing.
Oxley tries to reach for the skull, Spalko raises her hand to *
stop him. *
MAC (O.S.)
Skullís go a mind of its own, eh?
Spalko turns, startled. Mac is grinning. *
MAC (contíd)
Very choosy about who it talks to. *
Spalko cinches the bag shut. *
83 IN THE FRONT, *
 84A. 10/16/07
MAC
A lot of old cockswalop. People stare *
into that thing, work themselves up in a *
frenzy -- self-hypnosis, maybe something *
like that, ESP? I donít think so. *
SPALKO
Telepathy already exists in man, in a *
lesser developed form.
MAC
are you kidding? You think everybody is *
psychic? *
SPALKO
Youíre a gambler. Have you never played
a hung that proved correct? *
MAC *
Itís just luck. I should now mineís *
usually bad. *
She turns to face Mac. *
SPALKO *
We sent a submarine under the surface *
with a mother rabbitís new litter on *
board. She remained on shore while one by *
one, the young rabbits were exterminated. *
MAC *
Lady, you need a new hobby. *
SPALKO *
(ignoring that) Miles away, the motherís *
EEG readings showed reaction at the very *
instant of death. There is without a *
question an organic mind-body link shared *
by all living creatures; we must control *
that collective link-- *
She turns back. *
MAC *
alright, (he touches her shoulder)then *
you show me. I bet you double or nothing *
on my fee- *
(looks into her eyes)
-- what am I thinking right now?
Heís leering.
 85. 
SPALKO
Much too easy.
MAC
Besides that. Címon, amuse me. Iím *
thinking of a question. Whatís the
answer?
Spalko turns, raises her hand and looks him in the eye. He looks *
back at her, his usual leer at first, but as the stare goes on, it
fades.
Spalkoís eyes are intense, hypnotic. Beautiful eyes, but so cold
theyíre nearly white. Impossible to look away from.
Finally, after a long moment; *
SPALKO
The answer to your question is, ìIf I
feel the slightest need.î
She makes a movement with her hand under his neck, like a sword *
cutting his throat. Mac looks truly frightened, he sits back, *
silent.
Spalko turns around again, looking out the windshield. Oxley, *
whoís been following the conversation, looks back at Mac,
wondering what the hell he asked. But Mac is rattled, in a way we
havenít seen before. *
Suddenly, a voice BOOMS over the jungle:
MUTT (O.S.)
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!!
 85A. 
84 EXT/INT TRUCK DAY
Indy is in the back of the rear vehicle, hands tied behind his
back, as are Mutt and Marion. They bounce through the jungle,
guarded by the scowling Dovchenko. There are crates with
Cyrillic lettering piled all around them.
MARION
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I donít know
how to say this. ( I didnít want to tell
you) (I am just going to say it) Indyís
first name is Henry just like
yours(Colin wasnít your father-ng line
for the rest of the dialogue -indyís
response)Indyís your father
MUTT
WHAT? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!!RIGHT?
Mutt is outraged with Marion; heís just been told the news.
MUTT (contíd)
No, no, he was British, he was an RAF
pilot, my dad was a war hero, not some
school teacher!
MARION
No, sweetie. Colin was your stepfather.(step-dad) We started dating
when you were three months old. He was a
good man, but he wasnít your father.
INDY
Wait a minute, ìColin,î as in Colin
Williams? You married him? I
introduced you!
Dovchenko rolls his eyes -- he doesnít understand all of what
theyíre saying, but he knows heís sick of hearing it.
MARION
I think you gave up your vote on who I
marry when you decide to break it off a
week before our wedding.
INDY
It wasnít going to work, Marion, we both
knew that. (or) We both knew that it
wasnít going to work, Marion.
 86. 
MARION
You didnít know that, why didnít you just
talk to me? (or) why didnít you just try
talking to me?
INDY
Because we(or) I never had an argument
that I won.
MARION
Ha! Itís not my fault if you canít keep
up.
INDY
I didnít want to hurt you.
MARION
You failed. Didnít you ever wonder years
ago why Ox stopped talking to you?(years
ago) He hated that you ran away.
MUTT
Stop. Would you two stop ?
INDY
Yeah, Marion, letís not make the kid
listen to Mom and Dad fight.(or) letís
not have the kid hear mom and Dad
fight.(or) Letís not let him see Mom and
Dad fight.
DOVCHENKO
For the love of God, shut in hell up!
MUTT
Youíre not my dad!
INDY
You bet I am, and Iíve got news for you,
youíre going to go back and finish
school.
Dovchenkoís had it. CURSING A BLUE STREAK in Russian, he BANGS
his gun down on the floor and picks up a rag, spins it into a
tight line to use as a gag.
MUTT
Am I ? What?! What happened to ìthereís
not a dam(ng) thing wrong with it and
donít let anybody tell you any
different?! speech. You donít remember
that?
 87. 
INDY
That was before I was your father.
MUTT
Youíre not my father!
MARION
Oh yes he is!
Dovchenko enters & puts the gag on*
DOVCHENKO
For the love of God, shut the hell up!
INDY
You should have told me about the kid,
Marion. I had a right to know.
Dovchenko enters & puts the gag on*
MARION
You vanished after that.
INDY
I wrote.
MARION
A year later. By then Mutt was born and
I was married.
INDY
So whyíd you bother telling me now?
Dovchenko enters & puts gag on *
MARION
I thought we were gonna die!
Dovchenko is bending over Marion, as he finishes with the gag in
Marionís mouth. The angle gives Indy the perfect opportunity to--
INDY
Not yet!
--KICK HIM on his back.
With both feet, no less. Dovchenko falls against the side of the
truck, he looses his hat. He sits up and spins around, dazed, and
ends up in perfect striking range for Indy, He kicks him in the
face.
 87A. 
Dovchenko spins to Muttís side, Mutt lands a kick.
This sends Dovchenko back to Indy again. Indy kicks him again
back to Mutt.
Mutt kicks him again towards Indy.
Indy is about to kick him. Dovchenko slumps to the floor,
unconscious.
Mutt grins and kicks the switchblade out of his boot, where heís
hidden it. It THUNKS open on the floor of the truck.
Mutt grabs it with his two feet and throws it to Indy.
MUTT
You got it?
Indy doesnít answer.
MUTT (contíd)
Oh shit!.
Finally Indy gets his rope cut, he moves to them to get them
free.
 88. 
85 MOMENTS LATER, *
Indy removes the gag from Marionís mouth, then starts to untie *
her hands. *
Marion looks away from Indy, grumpy. Doesnít want to ask this,
but she canít help herself:
MARION
Iím sure I wasnít the only one who moved *
on with my life. There must of been *
plenty of women for you over the years. *
INDY
There were a few. But, they all had the *
same problem. *
The rope breaks and her hands pop free. *
Indy moves to the center of the truck he looks around for a way *
out of the truck. He looks up, at the canvas roof overhead. He *
uses the knife to cut an opening . *
MARION
yeah, what was that? *
INDY
they werenít you, honey.
Well, that just melts her. She looks at Indy. *
Muttís knife blade RIPS through the canvas a d tears a hole big *
enough for Indy to wriggle through. He pulls himself up and onto
the top of the truck. *
*
*
 89. 10/16/07
86 OMIT *
*
*
 90. 10/16/07
87 INSIDE THE TRUCK, *
Mutt and Marion are staring up at Indyís silhouette, visible *
through the canvas as he stands atop the truck. *
They watch the silhouette move toward the front of the truck,
leap into the air -- *
The truck swerves and SMASHES into a tree, throwing Mutt and
Marion forward violently.
 91. 10/16/07
88 IN THE CAB OF THE TRUCK, *
Indy throws the Driver out, and slides behind the wheel. *
89 WITH THE CONVOY,
we THUNDER through the jungle, the jungle-cutter SHRIEKING and
GASHING its way through the foliage.
90 INT TRUCK DAY
Indyís now driving the truck , he slides open the window to the *
back of the truck. Marion slides out and joins him. She smiles at *
him. *
INDY
We have to get Oxley back, get our hands
on that skull, and get to Akator before
they do. *
(to Marion)
Grab the wheel. *
And like that, heís gone, clambering into the back of the truck
as Marion slides over into the driverís seat.
Mutt slides out and joins her. *
MUTT *
Whatís he gonna do now? *
MARION *
I donít think he plans that far ahead. *
 91A. 
A LARGE BAZOOKA emerges from the back of the truck and pokes into *
the front seat between them, warhead first.
MUTT *
GAH!
Indy leans out the opening, hoisting the bazooka up on his *
shoulder.
INDY
(to Mutt)
Scooch over, son? *
MUTT
Donít call me son. *
But Mutt flattens himself against the seat as Indy swings the
head of the bazooka around, pointing out the passenger window.
Up ahead, the convoy is rounding a bend in the river, which means
thereís an open expanse of water between the lead vehicle, the
one with the saw blades, and the rear vehicle, the one Indy and
the others are in.
Indy sights over the barrel of the bazooka --
INDY
Might wanna cover your-
-- ìearsî is what he means to say, but before anybody can --- *
 92. 
91 ON THE RIVER,
the explosive head of the bazooka BLASTS out the passenger window
of the rear truck, SCREAMS across the open water, SLAMS into the
lead truck --
-- and the truck EXPLODES, turning a cartwheel. Its whirling saw
blades are blown free, ripping through the jungle like runaway
airplane propellers.
92 THE SECOND TRUCK,
swerves, narrowly missing the wreckage. Spalko and the others
duck as ONE OF THE WHIRRING SAW BLADES SCREAMS over their heads,
missing them by inches.
They come to a stop. Spalko stands and grabs the sack with the *
skull. *
 93. 
93 HALF THE CONVOY
SMASHES into itself, a chain reaction pile-up. The WHIRRING SAW
BLADE slices through the air over the top of the convoy, headed
toward the back, where --
94 IN THE REAR TRUCK,
-- Marion, Indy and Mutt duck, there is the horrible SHRIEKING
sound of tearing metal, and when they sit up --
-- THE TRUCKíS ROOF IS GONE.
95 IN THE SECOND VEHICLE,
Spalko holding the sack with the skull, looks back and sees the *
contrail still hanging in the air fro the rear vehicle, where
Indy shot the bazooka.
OXLEY *
Henry Jones Junior. *
She SHOUTS to the Driver of the jeep, who pushes the accelerator *
to the floor. *
SPALKO *
Vawn atsuda! (go, go, go) *
As the jeep barrels through the jungle, Spalko chases it and *
hands the sack to Mac. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
ZASHCHISHCHAITE CHERIP(Protect the *
skull!) *
-- She leaps onto the jeep just behind her. *
SPALKO (contíd) *
Slyeduiti za nimi (Follow them!) *
The Russian Soldier at the wheel keeps driving as she climbs in *
and grabs an automatic weapon from one of the soldiers. *
One of the soldiers (Pasha) yells after her *
PASHA *
Who caused this? *
SPALKO *
Jones! *
 94. 
96 IN THE REAR OF THE TRUCK,
Indy lands in the front seat of the cab, he SHOUTS to Marion, *
whoís still driving the truck, pointing at the vehicle in front
of them. Itís a duck (half truck half boat) with two Russian
Soldiers in it.
INDY
Pull up alongside that duck!
Marion hits the gas and the truck gains on the duck.
They drive by Pasha, he gets his rifle and fires at them. *
She pulls right up next to it, the Russians on board open fire --
-- and Indy leaps through the air, landing in the front of the
Russians' duck, fighting with the Driver and the Shooter.
 94A. 
97 IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK,
Dovchenko regains consciousness and sees the Driver and the
Shooter as theyíre hurled out of the duck and land in the jungle
foliage.
He turns and sees the duck through the torn side of the truck, and
now Indyís at the wheel, beckoning to Mutt and Marion to jump
aboard.
Mutt jumps, Marion legs go of the wheel and jumps --
-- and Dovchenko leaps into the front seat of the truck, taking
over the wheel before the truck crashes.
98 IN THE DUCK,
Indy hits the gas and passes the truck, quickly catching up to
the racing jeep with Spalko in it.
Spalko sees Indy approaching. She points with her right hand. *
SPALKO (TO THE DRIVER) *
Idiot! On Yedit! ( heís coming) *
But Spalkoís on her feet, and armed. She swings her weapon
around and opens fire.
99 IN INDYíS DUCK,
Marion sees it coming.
MARION
GET DOWN!
She grabs Indy. Mutt jumps up from the back, covers Marion and *
pulls them down a split-second before the windshield SHATTERS.
Spalko keeps firing and Indy slows down, which means her weaponís
BLASTING right at the jeep with Mac and Oxley and the Russian *
soldiers. The bullets miss them. *
Mac takes off his hat and checks to make sure he is alright. *
MAC *
Bloody Russians (he taps the driver in *
the shoulder) No disrespect comrade. *
 95. 
100 IN INDYíS DUCK,
Indyís caught up to the lead vehicle, the jeep which has Oxley,
Mac, and the skull in it.
INDY
(to Marion)
Ox has the skull. Marion take the wheel! *
Marion takes over and they pull up alongside the jeep.
Indy starts to get up. *
MUTT *
Thatís not fair, she drove the truck. *
INDY *
Donít be a child. Find something to *
fight with. *
Indy goes to the side of the duck ready to jump. *
Mutt begins to look around. *
Indy waits till the soldiers are blinded by intervening foliage --
-- and he leaps aboard the jeep, barreling into the Soldiers . *
One of the soldiers falls out of the duck. *
Indy starts to get up, Mac stands up, and is promptly re- *
introduced to Indyís fist. Mac collapses against the *
windshield. *
Indy turns and hits the soldier on his back-(dennis) then turns & *
hits the soldier next to him. (justin) *
Indy turns front passenger soldier(andy) is about to hit him , *
Indy ducks- the soldier hits the soldier behind Indy.(justin) *
Indy hits the soldier in the front(andy)- *
The gunner soldier (kenny) is about to grab Indy- Indy grabs him *
and throws him to the back- *
Indy turns & grabs the driverís head smashes into the steering *
wheel knocking him out- Indy grabs hold of Mac and puts his arm *
around his throat. *
MAC *
Indy, Indy. you broke my nose again! *
Indy grabs the wheel with one hand - *
 95A. 
Indy looks up ahead, sees a fallen tree on the jungle floor *
ahead. He swerves the jeep -- *
Marion and Mutt have been watching the fight. *
MARION *
He hasnít forgotten how to show a girl a *
good time eh? *
MUTT *
Mom canít you just think that type of *
stuff ha? (donít say it thereís no reason *
for it)(donít say it alright) *
 95B. 
101 IN THE JUNGLE, *
-- which drives directly over the fallen tree --
102 IN THE JEEP,
-- and the jeep bounces high into the air, sending the remaining
Russian Soldiers flying out of it.
The bag containing the Crystal skull flies into the air too, and
is about to go sailing out of the jeep --
-- when Harold Oxley, whoís in the back seat, reaches up and
catches it like a football.
But behind him, a Russian Soldier has held on to the racing jeep,
and is climbing back on board.
103 IN SPALKOíS JEEP,
she fires her gun again, but itís empty.
SPALKO *
Shurt! (shit) *
She tosses it aside and draws her rapier.
104 IN INDYíS JEEP,
Indy drives with his left hand and has Mac in a head lock. *
MAC *
Indy! *
INDY *
Shut up! *
MAC *
Indy! *
INDY *
Shut up! *
MAC
INDY, YOU STUPID SON OF A BITCH, IíM *
CIA! I practically shouted it at you in *
the ten, I said ìLike in Berlin!î What
were we in Berlin, mate?! *
INDY & MAC *
Double agents, yeah? *
 96. 
Behind them, unseen, the Russian soldier(andy) who was clinging *
to the back of the jeep finally hauls himself aboard. *
*
105 INT THE DUCK,
Marion drives while Mutt, in the back, opens up a long rosewood
case, searching for a weapon, any weapon.
He finds a box of swords and grabs one. Looking up, he sees *
Spalkoís jeep pull up alongside Indyís, where -- *
106 IN SPALKOíS JEEP *
Spalko drives up to the duck, she SCREAMS at the soldier in *
Indyís jeep, in English. *
SPALKO *
Throw me the skull! *
 96A. 
107 OMIT *
108 IN INDYíS JEEP,
the Soldier hears her and turns, sees the skull, in its burlap
bag, still in Oxleyís lap. He grabs it and tosses it to Spalko.
Mac immediately grabs the Soldier, PUNCHES him in the face, and
tosses him out of the jeep.
He turns goes back to Indy still pleading his case. *
MAC *
You think General Ross just happened to *
turn up in Nevada to bail you out? I sent *
him, heís my control agent! *
He looks at Indy -- see?! *
INDY
(to Mac)
Why didnít you say so before?! *
MAC
What do you want me to do, paint it on my
ass?!
Oxley looks back sees Spalko with the sack. *
Spalko opens the bag looks in, she cinches the bag. *
Indy tries to catch up. *
Spalko holds the bag up with her left hand and shows it to Indy *
with a smile.-- *
-- but she senses something behind her and as she turns, she
hears a HISSING sound in the air -- *
She looks to see Mutt, standing on the edge of the rampaging *
duck, holding her at rapier point.
Mutt swings again, and she counters the blow. Now, from their
standing positions atop the bouncing vehicles, they swing at each
other, wild vicious, barely controlled.
But clearly, both of them know how to handle a sword.
Indy keeps up with them, edging over closer to Spalko's jeep,
where the skull is.
 97. 
INDY *
Mutt get out of there! Marion turn off! *
Watch out! *
Oxley starts to get up, Mac pushes him down. *
MAC *
Who does he think he is Errol *
Flynn.(greaser thinks heís Errol Flynn) *
INDY *
Marion break off. (donít take her on) *
(not with her) *
Mutt lunges at Spalko with a furious combination of lunges and
attacks, but she parries them easily.
SPALKO
You fight like a young man -- eager to
begin, quick to finish.
Mutt attacks, one foot on each vehicle, and they start to move
apart. Heís clinging to both vehicles, splitting in half like a
wishbone. Spalko finds it amusing. *
Indy drives his duck towards Spalkoís jeep. *
The jeeps come together again and Spalko lunges, Mutt parries and
they spin around, falling backwards into each othersí vehicles.
 97A. 10/16/07
109 IN SPALKOíS JEEP,
Mutt looks down and sees the skull in the burlap bag. He grabs
it, turns hits the driver. Mutt gets up and shows the bag to Indy *
approaching in his duck. Mutt starts to swing it around his head. *
MAC *
Hey!(on 109A) hey I got it! *
INDY *
Throw me the bag! *
MAC *
Throw me the bag! *
But the Russian Soldier at the wheel takes out his gun. *
INDY *
Heís got a gun, watch the gun! *
Mutt SMASHES the driver with the bag holding the skull, drops the
bag and the sword and they start to wrestle for the gun.
110 IN MARIONíS DUCK
A sword RIPS through next to Marion as Spalko attacks her from *
behind.
Marion STOMPS on the brakes and Spalko flies out of the duck, but
manages to grab hold of the machine gun mounted on the front of
the vehicle.
The gun spins around, BLASTING shots through the windshield,
narrowly missing Marion.
As Spalko fires indiscriminately, Marion hits the gas, catching
up to --
 98. 10/16/07
111 SPALKOíS JEEP,
-- where Mutt continues wrestling with the driver. Shots go off *
from the gun. Marionís duck RAMS into the back end of the jeep and *
Spalko flies back landing at Muttís jeep and -- *
-- THE FIGHT RESUMES. *
Spalko turns and hits Mutt with her left, then her right, then *
her left and another right. Quick jabs. *
Mutt is able to grab her and throw her against the windshield. He *
grabs the bag with the skull, and punches the driver again. *
Spalko with her back to Mutt kicks him with her right foot right *
on his nose. *
Blood flows down his nose, Mutt is stunned. *
He gets up, she kicks him on the chest, then she kicks him lower. *
She puts all her strength into one last kick, he is at the back *
end of the jeep. *
He falls backwards, out of the jeep -- *
-- and onto the hood of INDYíS JEEP, which Indy has just driven up
behind them.
MAC *
Give me the bag! *
But as he falls, the burlap bag that holds the skull flies off *
Muttís hand and into Spalkoís hand. *
She catches it and smiles back at Mutt. *
 99. 
Marion is driving through the jungle, trying to catch up. She *
crashes into a ditch. *
She gets out and sees that her wheel is spinning, she gets a log *
places it under the tire and a rock. *
 99A. 
112 IN INDYíS JEEP,
Mutt climbs to his feet, ready again. *
MUTT
(to Indy)
What are you lookin at, daddy-o?. Címon *
sheís getting away. *
Indy hits the gas, Mutt turns, ready to leap onto Spalko's jeep,
but theyíre in an area with a lot of low-hanging vines now and --
-- MUTT IS SCOOPED UP INTO THE AIR!
Indy, Mac and Oxley lookup for Mutt. *
113 UP IN THE TREETOPS,
Muttís swept right up into the treetops, and lands, out of breath
and off balance, on a thick branch. He watches in panic as,
below, the jeeps race away without him. He turns --
-- AND SEES FIFTY MONKEYS ARE STARING AT HIM.
The monkeys one by one leap onto the vines, swinging away from *
Mutt.
Mutt grabs hold of a vine -- *
-- and swings away.
With the monkeys ahead of and behind him, Mutt swings on a vine
after vine, closing in on the convoy below.
 100. 10/16/07
114 DOWN BELOW,
Spalkoís jeep chases Indy in the truck, and now theyíre running
along the edge of a sheer cliff that drops five hundred feet
straight down to the raging Amazon.
Spalko SHOUTS at the Driver in Russian and slides over, taking
the wheel.
SPALKO *
Shivilyiteves! (move!) *
She catches up quickly and starts RAMMING into the side of Indyís
jeep, to knock him off the cliff.
They veer perilously close.
MAC *
Leave off! *
A Russian Soldier in Indyís jeep, previously unconscious,
awakens, sees theyíre about to go off the cliff, and bails out.
Mac follows him about to do the same changes his mind. Spalko *
rams into the side again. *
MAC (contíd) *
Will you please stop! *
115 UP IN THE TREES,
Mutt is still swinging, chasing the convoy. He grabs one last
vine, swings all the way to the end of its sweep --
116 IN THE JEEP,
-- Spalko is closing in for the final push, to knock Indy and the
others off the cliff --
SPALKO *
DAZVIDANYA DR. JONES!(goodbye Dr. Jones) *
 100A. 
-- and Mutt swings around and lands with a CRASH in her front seat!
He knocks Spalko into the passenger seat and grabs the bag with *
the skull in it.
Monkeys pour into the jeep, Mutt leaps over the windshield, onto
the hood, the Russian Soldier grabs the wheel as Mutt jumps --
117 IN INDYíS JEEP,
-- into the back of Indyís jeep. He drops the bag onto.... *
Oxleyís lap. He grabs the burlap bag, opens it and smiles. He *
cinches the bag and hugs it. *
Mutt on his back right next to Indy, giving him that hungry-for- *
praise look Indyís given so often.
MUTT *
Whoa. *
Indy gives him a half-smile back -- not bad, kid.
INDY *
Whoa? *
118 OMITTED *
119 OMITTED *
120 BEHIND THEM,
Spalko, enraged, grabs a monkey and hurls it off the cliff in
frustration.
121 FURTHER BACK, IN THE JUNGLE,
Dovchenko is still driving the damaged truck, picking up stray
Russian Soldiers. They head for the cliff edge with the others.
122 IN INDYíS JEEP,
Indyís eyes widen as he sees a huge dirt pile up ahead, blocking
their way completely.
INDY *
Whoaaaaa! *
Spalko sees the dirt pile approaching. *
The jeep goes airborne and SLAMS into the side of the soft dirt
mound.
 101. 
A moment later, thereís a ROAR as Spalkoís jeep flies into the
air above them, SLAMS down on top, and RUMBLES past them, coming
to rest near the top of the strange dirt pile.
Spalko pulls a gun from the holster of one of the Russian *
Soldiers.
Indy and his group come to and stat to move out, they see *
Spalko with the gun aimed at them -- *
-- and AN ANT, at least five inches long, crawls out onto her
hand!
The ant sinks its pincers into the soft webbing between her *
fingers.
She takes her left hand and swats the ant, blood pours out. *
Suddenly DOZENS OF ANTS pour into the Russian vehicle, through *
the air vents, out from around the pedals, materializing from *
everywhere. *
A THOUSAND MORE ANTS pour from the soft mount -- which is an ant *
hill, we now realize, for red army ants, ferocious and huge. *
INDY (contíd) *
SIAFU! GET OUT OF HERE!
As TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SIAFU stream out of the ant hill, Oxley
grabs the burlap bag, Mac grabs Oxley, Indy grabs Mutt, and the
four of them take off downhill. *
Spalko and her driver (Lee) chase them *
but the Russian truck driven by Dovchenko ROARS out of the
jungle. Dovchenko leaps out of the truck and tackles Indy. *
Dov lifts Indy off the ground, *
Indy yells to the others to keep going. *
INDY (contíd) *
Go! Get to the river! Go! *
They start to fight. *
 102. 10/16/07
123 ON THE GROUND, *
Oxley stumbles and falls in the mayhem. *
Mac and Mutt barrel toward the river, but the Russians in the *
truck pull even with them and raise their weapons. Mac and Mutt *
are dead for sure, but just as the Russians open fire -- *
-- A RAMPAGING DUCK ROARS up in front of the Russians with Marion *
at the wheel! *
124 IN THE DUCK, *
Marion ducks as the Russian GUNFIRE SCREECHES off the metal sides *
of the duck. *
But it allows Mutt and Mac to jump in from the other side, *
keeping low. *
Marion hits the gas and they take off toward the river. But they *
soon reach a short cliff. *
Marion stomps on the brakes and looks over the edge. She sees *
theyíre only about twenty or thirty feet above the river, and *
thereís a large tree halfway down. *
She turns the duck around, but sheís thinking something. *
 102A. 
125 BACK UPHILL, *
Indy and Dovchenko are in a fistfight for the ages, and Indyís *
getting his ass kicked. *
Indy rams into Dov, they fall to the ground. Indy punches him *
while he is on top of him. Dov pouts his left hand on Indyís face *
and pushes him off. Dov stands and grabs Indy by the ear- Indy *
gets up and punches Dov, once, twice, on the third one Dov ducks, *
Indy misses, Dov punches Indy on the side- Indy falls back to the *
ground- Dov takes Indyís hat off and pulls him by the hair with *
his left hand, he punches Indy back to the ground again. *
Worse the river of ants is heading right toward them. Just as the *
ants are about to swarm over all of them, Oxley, whoís still on *
the ground nearby, holds the Crystal Skull, he slowly removes the *
covering, the light gleams off it -- *
-- and the ants immediately divide into two columns and go right *
around them and the skull. *
126 NEARBY, *
Spalko, on foot now with a Russian Soldier, is racing toward *
where the fistfightís going on. *
But the ants overtake them. They swarm over the Soldier, *
dragging him down. Spalko moves up on a tree trunk, backing up *
away from the ants. The ants continue to move towards her, *
Spalko sees a vine, she jumps up and grabs it. She is hanging *
above the ants. The ants start to make a ladder by climbing on *
each other, trying to reach Spalkoís feet. Spalko climbs higher *
on the vine. One ant has managed to get on her leg, Spalko snaps *
her legs together and squashes the ant. *
SPALKO *
Idisuda!(ee-dee-soo-DAH) *
*
 103. 
127 BACK AT THE FIGHT,
Indy is now bleeding in his nose and mouth. Indy on his back
barely turns around and starts to crawl towards his hat, he is
about to pick it up but instead he picks up a large tree stick
with his right hand. Indy turns quickly and hits Dov with the
stick, and then punches him four times, Dovchenko lands flat on
his back --
-- in the middle of the sea of ants. They immediately overcome
him, going in his ears, his mouth, his nostrils -- and then start
biting to make holes of their own.
Dovchenkoís body starts to move, horizontally along the ground,
floating six inches above the jungle floor.
The Russian SCREAMS as the army ants carry him away to another
dirt mound and drag him down into it, to devour him in peace.
Indyís hat is also being carried by the ants into the anthill.
Indy walks up holding the skull, the ants move away, he picks up
his hat puts it on and moves towards Oxley
128 THE RUSSIAN TRUCK,
now fleeing the army ants like everybody else, reaches the edge
of the cliff Marion saw earlier.
The Soldiers pour out, carrying ropes and gear to rappel down the
cliff, anything to escape the ants.
Spalko gets out looks back, gets her rope and starts to head
down.
SPALKO
Da vai, da vai,(DUHvye, DUH VYE) GO GO
NOW!
 103A. 
129 IN MARIONíS DUCK, *
she sees Indy coming toward her, now carrying Oxley, whoís *
carrying the skull, and as long as he is, there is a halo of clear *
space around them where the ants will not go. *
Marion cranks the wheel, pulls up alongside them, and they leap *
in. Marion hits the wipers to clear a swarm of ants from the *
windshield and hits the gas. Indy sees sheís headed straight for *
the cliff edge.
MAC *
Slow down! *
MUTT *
Slow down Mom *
INDY *
Honey, you gotta stop or weíll go off *
the cliff! *
MARION *
Thatís the idea! *
INDY *
BAD idea!! Give me the wheel! *
Marion turns to him and smiles an Indy smile. *
MARION *
Trust me. *
The duck barrels straight off the edge of the cliff. *
130 IN MID-AIR *
the duck plummets for a few seconds and
131-133 CRUNCH! *
lands in a tree, slamming to a stop in the branches. Indy turns, *
sees the Russians still rappelling down the cliff face. The *
ants arenít far behind, pouring over the side of the cliff in *
pursuit *
Marion hits the gas and the truck lurches, wheels spinning in the *
branches, the trees GROANING forward with the shifting weight,
finally bending all the way over, to ground level.
*
 104. 10/5/07
The Russian Soldiers continue to climb down just as -- *
-- Marionís duck breaks free and roars off, releasing the tree *
and causing it to snap back all the way in the other direction -- *
-- and SWAT three or four of the Russian soldiers on the wall like *
a giant fly swatter. *
134 EXT AMAZON RIVER DAY
-- the Amazon river as A HUGE VEHICLE SPLASHES into it.
135 IN THE DUCK,
Marion cranks the wheel, trying to drive the thing in the raging *
current. She turns to Indy, a huge grin on her face. Indy *
shrugs, grumpily impressed. *
INDY *
Donít ever do that again! *
MARION *
Yes, dear. *
But the duck nearly goes under in a set of rapids. *
136 UNDERWATER,
the duckís wheels rotate flat, for flotation, and a set of
propellers at the rear SPIN to life, churning river water.
137 IN THE DUCK,
for a moment, the duck comes under control. Indy turns to Mutt,
grinning as they churn down river. *
INDY
You learn to fence like that in prep
school? *
MUTT
Just one more useless experience.
INDY
Iím not sure Iíd call that one
useless.(thatís one that turned out not *
to be useless.) *
MARION
He was fencing champ two years in a row,
but he got kicked out for betting on the
matches *
 105. 10/5/07
MUTT
It was smart. I bet on myself to win. I *
made a fortune.
Mac grins and SMACKS Mutt on the back.
MAC
Good boy.(thatís good son) *
(low, to Mutt)
Always have a little bet on the *
downside, in case you wanna throw one. *
INDY *
Outrageous! *
The rapids are getting heavier. *
Mutt, SCREAMS. He yanks his hand out of the water, and hereís a *
small, rainbow-bellied fish clamped down firmly onto one finger. *
MUTT *
PIRANHA! *
The others all start SCREAMING too. Mutt shakes the fish off *
violently. *
Just ahead of them. Oxley SHOUTS excitedly. *
OXLEY *
three times it drops! *
They all look, and start SCREAMING *
138 THE HUGE WATERFALL *
Itís gut-churning moment of free fall, everybody SCREAMING . *
The duck splashes into the water and pops right back out.. they *
are back in the rapids . *
*
 106. 10/5/07
139 RAPIDS *
Mutt and Indy fell out of the duck, they climb back and settle in. *
OXLEY *
The way down!(he points to land) *
MUTT *
He means by land, he came by land. *
INDY *
ìThree times it drops?î *
OXLEY *
Three times it drops! *
Heís pointing toward the shoreline, where they can see Spalko and *
the others, pursuing them from a pathway alongside the river that *
parallels the river. *
MARION *
Whatís he talking about? *
INDY *
He means. (he points behind them)One! *
(Then moves forward and points forward) *
Two!! *
And they look ahead, and we realize that thereís a *
A SECOND WATERFALL *
And they go airborne again. More screaming freefall. *
140 They emerge below into the rapids again. This time Mac,Indy and *
Mutt fell off the duck. They quickly climb back in. *
The duck races down the river towards the THIRD FALL. *
INDY (contíd) *
Three! *
Oxley takes the noose from the burlap bag and puts it around his *
neck. *
Mean Girl and the soldiers see them from a ledge. Mean girl *
watches the duck and hero crew. *
The duck races toward the waterfall edge. *
Indy takes off his hat, they are all still. *
 106A. 10/5/07
THE THIRD WATERFALL, *
Really makes the other two look lame. *
There's no hope of keeping the duck upright, the falls point *
straight down, tossing every body out into open space. *
They sail through the air, mercifully clear of the duck, and all *
five of them PLUNGE into the waters of the Amazon. *
But finally, some good news-- the river has mellowed out at this *
point, and all five heads pop back up above the surface. *
141 EXT RIVER BANK DAY
One by one, Indy, Marion, Mac, Mutt, and Oxley drag themselves
onto the riverbank and lie there, GASPING.
Indy helps Oxley to dry ground. *
He walks over to Marion and turns her toward him, making sure *
sheís all right. Sheís soaked and breathless, but sheís fine.
INDY *
Honey you alright? You okay? *
He grabs the wheel and yanks it off her hands. *
Indy looks at her, deep into her eyes for the first time in a long *
time. He looks exhausted. *
 107. 10/16/07
Oxley sits, facing away. He takes the burlap bag and places it *
in front of him, rotating it to face in the direction heís
looking.
A low-end vibration starts, barely audible at first, coming from
the skull. Tiny pebbles and bits of dirt on the ground around it
are jumping lightly into the air.
Indy walks over to Oxley and follows his gaze. There, towering
above them, A GREAT STONE HEAD is carved into the cliffs on the
shores of the river.
OXLEY
Through eyes that last I saw in tears...
Mutt looks up suddenly, recognizing those words.
MUTT
(finishing the quote)
ìthe golden vision reappears!î Itís T.S. *
Eliot! You made me read it. *
(to the others)
ìThrough eyes that last I saw in tears,
here in deathís dream kingdom, the
golden vision reappears!î
MAC
gold?! Iím in. *
Muttís still thinking, looking up at the cliff. He sees that a
waterfall runs out of the left eye of the carved face.
MUTT
Through eyes in tears, we go through the
waterfall!
Indy looks at him, impressed, then looks back up at the cliffs.
 108. 10/16/07
INDY
This skull has to be returned. Iíll do *
it. Nobody else has to come. *
MUTT
Who cares? That thingís brought us *
nothing but trouble. (points at Oxley) *
Look what it did to him. *
INDY *
I have to return it. *
MARION *
Why you? *
INDY *
Because ti told(asked) me to. *
MUTT *
It asked(told) you to? A hunk of dead *
rock? *
INDY *
(matter-of-fact)
What makes you think itís dead?
Slowly, they all turn and look at the skull. We move in close on
it, and as we draw in --
DISSOLVE TO:
142 EXT CLIFFS OF AKATOR DAY
-- dissolve to that same face, only huge, and carved in rock.
Indy and the others have made their way up the steep face and are
just beside the waterfall that spills out of the giant eye. *
143 OMIT *
 109. 10/16/07
144 EXT RIVERíS EDGE DAY
The wreckage of the duck that Indy and the others rode over the
falls is washed up on the shore of the river. Irina Spalko and
the few remaining Russian Soldiers, their arms and necks inflamed
by the pincer marks of the army ants, have just hacked their way
through the jungle at the riveís edge. Theyíre still carrying
the ropes and other gear they used to rappel down the cliff face
at the river.
Spalko picks up one of the diode from the floor, she glances down *
at it. She looks out across the water and sees-- *
--the Giant Face carved into the cliffs of Akator. *
She suddenly weakens, overcome by a powerful feeling. *
SPALKO
Into the water. *
 110. 10/17/07
145 INT CAVE DAY
Indy helps Oxley get up into the cave, Marion holds onto his arm.
Indy leads them into the cave- Mac is holding a flashlight. The
are struck by a cave painting in front of them. CLOSE ON the cave
walls as Indy gently touches the first painting, a depiction of a
group of squat human figures, hands stretched aloft to the sun.
INDY
(feeling the materials)
Ochre... iron oxide....charcoal...
MAC
How old is this?
INDY
Four, five thousand years, old as the
pyramids. Sun worshippers like the
Egyptians.
While Indy studies the painting, Mutt notices there are a series
of torch-holders in the walls. There are smears of black reside
above them, and Mutt runs his fingers over them. The residue
comes off on his skin.
MUTT
these are fresh. These were just used.
But the others are too distracted by the paintings to pay
attention.
 110A. 
They move to the next panel. The group of humans are looking up
at the sky as a figure is lowering form the heavens -- humanoid,
but taller, thinner, glowing.
MARION
More worshippers.
INDY
Thatís not the sun theyíre worshipping
though.
INDY (contíd)
Someone came.
They keep moving. There are more alien figures now, and theyíre
moving among the human figures, building, farming.
INDY (contíd)
Taught the Ugha -- farming, irrigation --
Oxley holding onto the burlap bag with the skull, moves into
another room he sees---
The next drawing a more detailed version of the visitor, just its
torso and cranium, in profile.
Oxley reaches into his bag, pulls out the Crystal Skull.
Indy and the rest of the group enter the room.
MARION
Ox, what is it?
Indy hands the torch to Mutt and approaches Oxley, he reaches for
the skull. Oxley is hesitant to give it up.
INDY
I understand.
Indy takes it and moves closer to the wall ....
CHANGED THE ACTION: new action
Oxley and the rest of the group enter the room. Marion moves to
Oxley she puts her hand on his shoulder.
MARION
Ox, what is it?
Indy hands the torch to Mutt and moves in front of Oxley.
 111. 
INDY
I think I understand Ox. Someone came.
Indy looks at the painting, mesmerized. Oxley takes the skull and
raises it with his right hand, creating a shadow
He holds it up against the painting --
-- and itís an exact match.
MARION
is this the same as that? (or ) Are they
the same?
Indy has been looking at another painting behind them.
INDY
Itís not the only one. (or) there were
more, look in a circle.
He moves to the next picture, a group of shots of a circle of the
taller figures, all grouped around a central area.
Oxley moves ahead of them, Indy joins him.
INDY (contíd)
Show us the way, Ox.
Oxley moves slowly at first, then starts to pick up speed. They
move ahead, into a darker antechamber. Itís harder to make out
the paintings here, but the scale is massive.
They pass through the cave and into --
 111A. 
146 INT CAVE ROTUNDA DAY
-- a large rotunda area. Above them, there are thirteen skulls
carved into the ceiling. As they pass underneath, one of the
skulls OPENS ITS EYES.
The eyes follow the humans passing below, and then the thin rock
starts to chip away as a form presses into it from above.
Itís a REAL Ugha warrior.
Now all the skulls start to open their eyes and we realize these
are surveillance perches, thereís a whole system of tunnels up
above them.
The UGHA WARRIORS SWARM DOWN FROM THE CEILING, they start to
follow Oxley and the group
Indy, Mac, Marion and Mutt stop they hear something.
Oxley up ahead stops, listens.
OXLEY
ìto lay their just hands on that golden
Key...that opeís the Palace of
Eternity.î
He repeats is several times.
Marion joins him.
MARION
Shhh, listen.
They stop.
Indy realizes what is happening.
INDY
Letís go. Go, go, go....
They all take off, barreling through the rotunda toward the
sliver of light at the far end.
-- The SHRIEKING UGHA WARRIORS ARE FLYING OWN TOWARD THE GROUP!
The Warrior whirls a BOLA BELT over its head (so that was the
whirling helicopter blade image)
 112. 
--UGHA WARRIORS SWARM DOWN FROM THE CEILING, jumping, swinging,
climbing down on vines.
Indy rips the bola from around Muttís neck, drags him to his
feet, and they all take off, barreling through the rotunda toward
the sliver of light at the far end.
 112A. 
147 EXT CAVE ENTRANCE DAY
Mayhem spills out of the mouth of the cave -- Indy, Mac, Marion,
and Mutt, pursued by a dozen SHRIEKING WARRIORS and WHIRLING
bolas.
Oxley takes off down a set of carved steps toward --
148 -- AKATOR.
The ruins of the city are set in a hollow depression in the center
of the plateau-atop-a-plateau, rimmed by clouds, with a huge, manmade reservoir carved into the hilltop above it.
Though the jungle has grown up around it, we can see its spiral
design radiates out from a Great Stone Temple. The pathways are
smooth and straight, bordered by aqueducts which carry the water,
flowing from the reservoir above, throughout the city, and
plunging down into the base of the temple itself.
Indy is running with Oxley, suddenly they are knocked to the
ground by the bolas.
Mac falls.
Marion falls. One of the holes WHAPS through the air, wraps
around Muttís neck--
-and SLAMS him to the floor.
The warriors surround Marion and Mutt. Mutt takes his knife and
cuts the bolas off his neck. He moves next to Marion trying to
protect her.
MARION
Indy!!!
Mac sees the Warriors around him and he also yells.
MAC
JONESEY!!!
Indy looks around, knows theyíre not going to win this fight. He
SHOUTS to Oxley, desperate:
INDY
Oxley! You were here before, how did you
get past ëem!
The warriors move in closer with their spears, suddenly they stop
 113. 
Oxley gets up with the skull in his hands --
-- and holds it over his head.
The skull catches the light of the sun and refracts out through
the lensed eyes in brilliant beams. The light streams out
everywhere, through the ears, the nose, the mouth, and the low
HUM we heard before gets louder, the skull vibrating madly,
actually BLURRING in Oxleyís hands as he holds it over his head.
To a man, the Ugha warriors freeze in their tracks, starting at
the skull in terrified fascination.
Indy grabs onto Oxley as the Ughas shrink back.
INDY (contíd)
Oxley, Marion.
Indy pulls Oxley along, they make their way towards Mac. The Ugha
are afraid to follow them.
INDY (contíd)
Címon Mac.
Mac crawls towards Marion and Mutt.
OXLEY
ìTo lay their just hands on that golden
Key...that opeís the Palace of Eternity.î
INDY
You did good Ox.
They reach Marion and Mutt.
They take off, toward the temple in the distance.
They reach the temple and scamper up its terraced sides. The
Ugha do not follow.
 114. 
149 ON TOP OF THE STONE TEMPLE,
the group staggers onto the flat top of the temple. Thereís a *
large square box filled with sand, and a fifteen foot stone
obelisk lying on its side. One end of the obelisk is supported by
a cut-out chunk of hillside, the heavier and lying in the center
of the stone box.
Mac looks around. *
MAC *
The city of gold, so whereís the gold? *
He throws a piece of artifact on the ground in disgust. *
MAC (contíd) *
Look at the state of this place! *
What a stupid legend. What a waste of my *
time.
Indy is standing by the top of the steps with Oxley. Oxley goes *
down the steps. Indy follows him. *
Mutt squats down watching them, Marion stands next to him. *
INDY *
Ox was here before, but he couldnít get *
into the temple, so he put the skull back *
to he cemetery where he found it. *
Oxley bends down and picks up a handful of sand, he pours it into *
Indyís hand. *
OXLEY
ìTo lay their just hands on that Golden
Key... that opeís the Palace of
Eternity.î
Indy grins and turns to Oxley, pointing at the obelisk.
INDY
Golden key, right? *
(to the others)
This obelisk, is the key to getting into *
the temple. *
Indy leans on the obelisk. *
 114A. 
OXLEY *
To lay their just hands on that golden *
key... *
Oxley starts to walk around the obelisk. *
INDY *
Thatís it, thatís it! *
Indy follows Oxley around the obelisk. *
OXLEY *
That opeís the Palace of Eternity. *
Through eyes that last I saw in *
tears....Here In deathís dream *
kingdom....gold vision Reappears *
INDY *
What are you doing Ox? What are you *
looking for? *
Oxley stops in front of one of the stone heads. A small trickle of *
sand is running out from around the edges of a plug of some kind, *
one of a series of such plugs. *
INDY (contíd) *
You figured(worked) this out in your *
cell didnít you Professor? Well done. *
He gets an idea, goes to pick up a stone. *
Mac moves in to look at the plugs. *
MAC *
Excuse me Professor. *
As Mac looks at the stone, Indy , holding a huge chunk of rock *
over his head, moves forward toward Mac, ROARING with effort. *
INDY *
Move please. (Just move please Mac) *
Mac turns and reacts. *
MAC *
Donít kill me! *
Muttís face lights up, he gets it, he also goes to get a rock. *
Mac lunges out of the way as Indy SLAMS the rock down on the
square stone plug at the base of the stone box. Thee plug gets *
loose and a stream of sand flows out of the hole. *
 115. 
Indy turns and gives the rock to Mac to hold. Indy removes the *
stone head, and more sand flows out. He gets his rock back from *
Mac. *
INDY *
Go get one of your own. *
Mutt enters with a rock and SLAMS it into another plug. More *
sand flows out. *
Now Indy and Mutt move quickly from plug to plug, SMASHING them
with rocks, KICKING the plugs out, sand rushing onto the ground. *
Now Mac and Marion pitch in, kicking plugs out, shoving the rocks *
away to let the sand flow freely out of the pit. *
Oxley is seated nearby watching them with a smile. He looks up. *
 115A. 
150 EXT THE STONE BOX DAY *
Indy hits the last stone off the base. As the level of sand goes *
down, the base of the obelisk, which was resting on that sand *
also goes down. *
Indy hears the rumble, he stand and looks to see, ten tons of *
stone- aided only by gravity, slowly move to vertical. *
As the base goes down, the four horizontal pillars, start to rise *
into the air. Indy and the others watch. The four obelisk pieces *
click together. *
The floor of the pit starts to RUMBLE and GROAN *
The rest of the sand falls away quickly from below the group, *
they fall through with the sand onto -- *
A SET OF STAIRS in a darkened area. *
Indy sits up. *
INDY *
Listen you hear that? *
They all sit up. *
INDY (contíd) *
Itís not over! *
 116. 
151 INT TEMPLE DAY
A mechanism trips and the steps start to retract, into the walls.
The group gets up and starts to descend the stairs. Oxley is in
front, he is holding the skull in his arms wrapped under his
serape. Indy is behind him. They leap as they race down, trying
to get to the bottom before the steps disappear completely.
INDY
Letís go , move faster. Move, move. This
is not good. Move Ox, move. Faster Ox.
Indy looks back and sees that Marion is falling behind.
INDY (contíd)
Go back(get) and help your mother.
Mutt stops and waits for Marion
MUTT
Ma!
MARION
Donít stop for me, keep going.
Marion catches up, Mutt gives her his hand, they continue down.
As the group heads down, we drop down to their feet, to their
footprints, the stairs getting smaller.
Indy puts his back against the wall, the other follow, the stairs
keep retracting.
Indy falls, one by one they all fall.
The group has landed on water. Marion is coughing.
Mutt sees that Oxley has lost the skull.
They begin their search.
Mac looks around for gold.
MAC
whereís your gold mate?
He finds a coin, puts it away.
Indy helps Marion.
 116A. 
INDY
Are you alright? (You okay?)
MARION
Yeah.
Marion embraces Indy, they have a moment and look at each other.
Suddenly Mutt comes up with a soldier skeleton and hands it to
Indy.
MUTT
Here hold this.
He continues to search for the skull in the water. He finds it
and hands it to Oxley.
MUTT (contíd)
Ox, here.
Oxley takes it and embraces it.
OXLEY
The golden visionary reappears.
He covers it.
Mutt starts to walk away, stops.
MUTT
Letís go.
He walks further away, stops and looks at Indy.
MUTT (contíd)
This way?
Indy heads out the others follow.
CUT TO:
 116B. 
152 EXT CLIFFS OVER AKATOR DAY
Ugha Warriors lie on the ground riddled with bullets. *
Irina Spalko walks towards the temple. *
At the stone steps that lead to Akator, she picks up an *
identical DIODE flashing. *
She looks at a tracking device in her hand. *
She gestures and starts to go up the steps of the temple, the *
soldiers follow her. *
CUT TO: *
153 INT TEMPLE BASE DAY *
Indy and the others move around the obelisk, they reach the other *
side. *
Indy finds a torch. *
INDY *
Mac gives us a light. *
Mac lights it with his lighter. They move into an opening. *
They go through the tunnel and continue to move deeper into the *
temple base. *
As the group moves on, we drop down to their feet-- *
--and to the small FLASHING DIODE that one of them (MAC) has just *
dropped in their tracks. *
*
 116C. 
153A INT CORRIDOR DAY *
A hundred feet below ground level, Indy, Marion, Oxley, Mutt and *
Mac enter a corridor, away from the sunlight above. But the *
light seems to follow them, streaming through strategically *
placed fissures in the temple walls and bouncing off smoothly *
polished areas on the stone surfaces. *
As they move on, they notice precious jewels, set in ornate *
silver settings and hung upon the walls. Mac CHIPS one out of
the wall, drops it in his pocket, grinning to himself as he
studies the dozens ahead. *
Indy leads them to a large opening, in the middle of the corridor *
are large quartz shapes hanging in the ceiling. Mutt moves *
closer and touches one of them. *
MUTT *
What is it? *
INDY *
I have no idea. (youíre asking me?) *
Indy moves on, they all follow. *
 117. 10/4/0
154 INT ANTECHAMBER DAY *
The group come down the stairs into an opening. Indy puts the *
torch down and heads down, the group follows him *
The room is very different, it is full of things. *
Mac studies the room, but itís the bracelets and rings that heís *
interested in. *
MAC *
Thatís more like it! *
They walk cross further into the room. *
There are niches all over the wall, crammed with antiquities *
from every era imaginable. Indy marvels at them: *
INDY *
Artifacts, from every era of *
mankind(early history). *
Macedonian...Sumerian... *
MUTT *
This place is the mother lode. *
INDY *
Struscan...Babylonian... *
MAC *
thereís not a museum on earth(in the *
world) wouldnít sell its soul for this *
lot. *
INDY *
Early Egyptian. *
MAC *
A dozen museums, a hundred of them, *
Jonesy! *
Mac walks away. *
INDY *
Collectors. (a grin) They were *
archaeologists. (he realizes that Ox is *
not next to him) Ox? , Ox? *
Oxley walked over to the side of the chamber, there are two giant *
doors, seemingly carved from a single giant block of iron ore. *
He uncovers the skull, the skull starts to vibrate. *
 118. 9/30/07
Mac walks around the room and begins to fill his pockets with *
coins, jewelry and precious stones. *
Marion walks over the touches the skull, she takes her hand away. *
Mutt joins them and also touches the vibrating skull, Indy joins *
them. *
MUTT *
How do we open it? *
Indy looks and sees the recess that is over the head of the door. *
And itís empty. *
Indy sizes it up, thinking. *
He turns to Oxley and reaches for the skull. Oxley hesitates, but *
Indy puts his hands gently on the skull. *
INDY *
Iíll give it back, Harold. *
Reluctantly, Oxley lets it go. *
INDY (contíd) *
I promise. *
Indy moves to the door and shoves the Crystal Skull into the *
recess above the door. It fits perfectly, as if the recess was a *
mold. *
Immediately, the skull glows, brighter than it ever had, and all *
at once-- *
Indy steps back to the group. *
Mac joins them, he is now loaded with bracelets and rings in his *
pockets and around his neck. *
The doors begin to GROAN, the arrows comes down pushing the *
balls down, the zig zag door opens. They RUMBLE open slowly, and *
SLAM all the way to he bottom, revealing-- *
 119. 10/1/07
155 INT TEMPLE HEART DAY
-- a blindingly lit room.
Indy pulls the skull free from the recess, hops back to the
ground, and hands it back to Oxley. They all come inside,
blinking at the roomís radiance.
Itís round, built in the style of the time, along the lines of a
throne room. Carved totems fill every nook and crannny. *
And there, seated upright in a circle atop a massive circular
altar are THIRTEEN FLAWLESS CRYSTAL SKELETONS, nearly seven feet *
tall each.
Oxley sees one in particular--because it has no skull atop its *
shoulders. Oxley still holding the skull, starts to walk forward, *
toward the altar that holds the headless body-- *
OXLEY *
(softly, to the skull)
No more forever waiting soon now.
Oxley uncovers the skull and aims it towards the altar. *
They all stare transfixed -- *
 119A. 
-- and Indy hears a CLICK behind him. *
He turns around.
Mac is pointing a gun at them.
MAC
Sorry, old son(Jonesy) *
INDY
Why donít you make up your mind, which *
side our on? *
MARION
Iím getting REALLY tired of this guy.
MAC
(calling out)
Ya evo poimal!(got him) *
And now, from the entrance to the final chamber --
-- the four Russian Soldier step into the room. *
Indy looks back at Mac, more irritated than anything.
INDY
So youíre what? A triple agent? *
MAC
Nah, I just lied about being a double.
(to Marion)
Donít worry, you can come with us.
MARION
HAH! Fat chance. *
 120. 10/16/07
Spalko enters the room, a rush runs through her body, and she *
looks up at the others, eyes shining.
SPALKO
Look at them.
She comes up the steps . *
SPALKO (contíd) *
Still waiting. For the return of the one *
who was lost. *
She looks around the room at the twelve others. *
SPALKO (contíd)
Theyíre a hive mind, one being,
physically separate, but with a
collective consciousness. More powerful
together than they could ever be apart.
She walks up to Oxley and gently takes the Crystal Skull from *
Oxleyís hands and regards it, alas-poor-Yorick style. *
SPALKO (contíd)
Imagine what theyíll tell us.
She walks toward the altar that contains the headless body. *
INDY
I canít imagine. *
(she turns, looks at him)
Neither could the humans who built this
temple, and neither can you.
She starts to climb the altar, toward the mummy. *
SPALKO
Belief, Dr. Jones, is a gift you have
yet to receive. My sympathies. *
INDY
Oh, I believe, sister. Thatís why Iím *
down here. *
Atop the altar now, she raises the skull toward the mummy. A
magnetic field grabs it out of her hand, pulling it forward --
-- and sucking it into place atop the mummyís shoulders.
 121. 10/2/07
A RUMBLING rises up in the room, the bodies themselves begin to *
vibrate. *
Viscous fluids flow through the stone, these were living things, *
and theyíre coming back to life. The main skeleton, the one to *
which the Crystal skull was returned, blurs and its flesh *
returns, soft, living flesh once again, eyes that see, hands that *
move. *
Spalko backs up back to the group. *
Oxley, who is staring at the skeleton, transfixed, moves towards *
the altar and begins to speak, low and rapid. But it isnít *
English, itís-- *
Indy and Spalko move next to Oxley *
INDY (contíd) *
Mayan. Heís speaking Mayan. *
SPALKO *
What does he say? *
Oxleyís lips moving rapidly, strange, ancient sounds coming out *
of his mouth. *
Indy listens, Oxley, is still talking. Indy tries to decipher. *
INDY *
He says heís grateful, he wants-- *
(correcting himself, he means the *
skeleton)-- *
Indy turns and looks at the skeleton. *
INDY (contíd) *
--it wants to give us a gift. *
The Being seems to look right back at him. Spalko moves closer to *
the altar. *
INDY (contíd) *
A big gift. *
Spalko is speaking to the figure on the altar, low, fervent, *
almost a prayer. *
SPALKO *
Tell me-- everything you know, I want it *
all, I want to know -- *
The skeleton sees her and seems to respond. *
 122. 10/2/07
Something has begun. Indy moves back next to Mutt. *
INDY *
Iíve got a bad feeling about this. *
Spalko is transfixed. She locks eyes with the Main skeleton. *
Marion is amazed too staring at them. *
MARION *
Indy, their eyes! *
-- the RUMBLING grows louder, and the stone walls of the room *
crack and crumble. *
Mac knows a bad situation when he sees it. He takes off out of *
the opening is starting to move away, he ducks out into the *
tunnel that leads to the antechamber. *
The sides of the room start to spin, slowly at first, but gaining *
speed, like a centrifuge. *
MUTT *
What are they, space-men?! *
Harold Oxley is suddenly and completely restored to his normal *
self. *
OXLEY *
Inter-dimensional beings, in point of *
fact. *
INDY *
(surprised) Welcome back, Ox. *
A swirling black sinkhole forms in the center of the whirling *
room. *
MARION *
What the hell is that? *
OXLEY *
A portal! A pathway! *
INDY *
I donít think we want to go that way. *
Indy moves Oxley and Marion and pushes them out the exit. *
Indy and Mutt wait for the room to make another circle , and then *
they bolt for the exit. *
 122A. 10/2/07
The soldiers chase after them, they are sucked up into the *
ceiling by the spinning walls. Spalkoís face glows in the *
brilliant light of the Skullís eyes. The walls of the room are a *
blur of motion now. The skeletons surround her. *
But Spalko remains, still staring into the eyes again. *
SPALKO *

see, I can see. Cover it. *
A157 INT. TEMPLE HEART-DAY *
In the throne room, the walls are spinning faster now, Spalko *
continues to stare, eyes wide, temples throbbing. This is what *
she came for. *
A158 INT. TEMPLE HEART-DAY *
More Spalko *

156 INT ANTECHAMBER DAY *
Mac comes out of the tunnel and starts to head up the stairs. He *
stops and heads back down, he starts to pick up more loot. *
Oxley with Marion come through the tunnel. Marion wants to go *
back, Oxley stops her. *
OXLEY *
Donít even think about it. *
Indy with Mutt enter the antechamber through the tunnel. Marion *
makes sure that Mutt is alright. *
MUTT *
I am fine. *
Marion goes to Indy, they embrace. *
Mutt goes to Oxley. *
MUTT (contíd) *
Ox? Do you know who I am? *
OXLEY *
Multiple dimensions! Fascinating to *
ponder Mutt! Mignon Thorne wrote an *
interesting perspective, teased out the *
notion of changeable physics -- *
Indy realizes that something is happening. *
INDY *
NOT A GOOD TIME FOR THIS, OX! *
He pushes them up the stairs. Indy stops, Mac comes up from *
behind the artifacts. *
MAC *
I winked(I always winked). *
Indy puts his finger up. *
INDY *
Nyet. *
The look at each other. Indy joins the group and they head out. *
Mac goes back to gathering more loot. *
OXLEY *
Changeable physics a bit like eddy in *
water, what with hot and cold spots, see *
what Iím getting at? *
 123. 10/2/07
Indy stops at the top of the stairs, he turns and calls Mac. *
INDY *
Mac come on! Mac! *
Mac keeps picking up more stuff. Indy goes down closer to Mac. *
INDY (contíd) *
Mac! Now! *
Mac looks at him, but he moves to another area and keeps picking *
up things. *
INDY (contíd) *
Mac! Damn it! *
Behind Mac, the black sinkhole is coming forward. Mac turns and *
moves towards Indy, heís pulled to the ground. *
The sinkhole is advancing toward Mac, and the denseness of its *
gravity is pulling him and everything else toward it-- *
Mac looks up at Indy, knows heís in a serious jam. *
Indy takes out his whip and throws the handle to Mac. Mac grabs *
onto it. Mac continues to be drawn toward the pit *
INDY (contíd) *
Come on Mac, use your feet (legs). I *
canít do it alone. *
Macís face falls, thereís no way out of this. *
MAC *
Jonesy Iím gonna be alright. *
He winks. He lets go of the whip, his body is immediately sucked, *
into the void. *
Indy falls back onto the stairs, takes one last look stands and *
heads out with the rest of the group. The stairs right behind *
them are behind sucked away. *
 123A. 10/2/07
C158 INT. TEMPLE HEART-DAY *
the sides of the temple room whirl faster and faster, just a blur *
now, and Spalko tears her away from the gaze of the bodies *
theyíre facing, but when she turns around-- *
--ONE OF THE BODIES IS STANDING RIGHT BEHIND HER. *
It seems impossible that it got there so quickly, but there are *
its eyes, shining even BRIGHTER, so she turns again-- *
--and THEREíS TWO MORE OF THEM on the other side of her, right *
there, eyes beaming righter still. *
SPALKO *
COVER IT! COVER IT! *
*
*
*
 123B. 10/2/07
But thereís no one left to cover it and sheís in he center of a *
circle, so everywhere she turns, there is a body standing right *
there, its eyes burning like laser beams. *
Spalko starts to BABBLE in that alien language the body spoke, *
otherworldly sounds coming out of her, fast, and now she SCREAMS
as it all pours into her, too much, far too much, the veins in
her temples throb and swell -- *
-- her eyes drip blood, but she doesnít collapse, she stays on
her feet. *
Smoke curls up from her eyes, her eyeballs flutter and bounce, as *
if her brain is boiling water and theyíre floating on top of it,
she SCREAMS -- *
SPALKO (contíd) *
I can still see!!! *
-- GEYSERS OF FLAME burst from her eyes.
It flairs up, hollowing out her eye sockets, and whatever was
left of her eyes burns out and drips down her face, dark, black
matter --
-- and her arms drop to her sides, lifeless, revealing two
oversized, black, hollow eye sockets, just like the corpses
outside the door.
She falls to the ground, dead.
And at that very moment, the Thirteen Crystal Skeletons begin to
vanish, one by one. They donít disappear, or get in a ship and
fly away, itís more that they slip away, turning sideways and
sliding into thin air, or another dimension, or someplace we
cannot grasp. *
The sinkhole in the center of the room both implodes and explodes *
at the same time, sucking everything into it and expanding at the *
same time. *
 124. 10/2/07
*
 125. 10/2/07
157 INT TEMPLE CORRIDOR DAY *
Indy and the others race into the corridor with the quartz *
hangings from the ceiling. Everything continues to get sucked *
back into the sinkhole. Oxleyís still making his point. *
OXLEY *
Migno Thorne called them, ìPost- *
inflation bubbles,î assuming universal *
expansion-- *
Indy runs to one end of the hallways, the walls are EXPLODING *
with rocks blocking the way out. Indy runs back to another *
corridor. *
OXLEY (contíd) *
--and therefore random pockets of *
extrinsic physics-- *
INDY *
Ox! *
OXLEY *
What? *
INDY *
Ox shut up! *
Indy takes off, they all follow. *
C158 INT. TEMPLE CORRIDOR DAY *
Indy and the group come out to an opening. *
OXLEY *
(finishing)-- different realities could *
reside in the same space at the same
time, completely unaware of one another. *
They see a huge set of sets, with huge turbines on both sides. The *
group heads up. The turbines crashing behind them, water pouring *
everywhere. *
They reach the top and go around another set of turbines. *
The group continue to run. Just then, with a great CRACK, the *
walls around them split and water races towards them. *
 126. 10/4/07
*
 127. 10/2/07
158 INT TEMPLE - ASCENDING TUNNEL DAY *
They race through an ascending tunnel. Its walls are made of *
quartz, and through it they can see thousands of tons of water
flowing around them. *
They reach a dead end. They look up and see an opening. RUMBLING *
of water gets louder towards them . *
Water cascades into the quartz tunnel, ROARING up behind them. *
It overtakes them, sweeping them along, the tunnel fills up- and *
a whirlpool begins- forcing them upward --they swirl all the way *
up -- *
159 EXT AKATOR DUSK
-- and EXPLODING out the top of the tunnel, some distance away
form the temple itself. They land on the side of the cliffs that
surround Akator, a short distance from the top.
Behind them, the Great Stone Temple is crumbling, collapsing into
its center area, debris of all kinds whirling as if in a gigantic
centrifuge.
160 EXT PLATEAU - ABOVE AKATOR DUSK
The four survivors scramble up a small incline as behind them,
the Great Stone Temple completely flattens with a gigantic BOOM,
devastating the entire plateau as its great weight drops all at
once, filling the space created by the giant sinkhole.
The four survivors duck for cover, behind the rocks. *
The huge cloud of whirling debris still spins around a glowing
orb in the center, itís the base of the temple, the spinning,
shining, silvery walls that surrounded the temple room.
But now the orb itself turns sideways and vanishes, and as it
does, the giant cloud of debris is sucked onto the tiny dot into *
which the orb disappeared, leaving not a speck of dust behind as *
evidence. When this last bit of support is yanked from the *
landscape, the cliffs around it collapse and, with a sound like a
bedsheet RIPPING in half --
-- the great reservoir on the hillside across from them CRACKS in
half, sending its ocean of water cascading down over the ruins of
the city, flowing over the rubble and filling up the space, like
the Red Sea flowing back into place.
 128. 10/17/07
Indy, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley collapsed on the hillside as the *
churning waters settle, turning what was once the greatest city
of all time into a peaceful mountain lake . *
Indy stands and looks out. *
INDY *
Did you see that? *
OXLEY *
Like a broom to their footprints...
Itís dusk now, and the first stars are coming out. Slowly, the
sounds of the jungle return.
INDY
Where did they go?
(looks up)
Space? *
OXLEY
Not into space. Into the space -- * -- between spaces.
Indy looks at his frail, scholarly old friend is wonder. *
MUTT
(looking down at the ruins)
I donít get it. The legend said it was *
suppose to be a city of gold. *
INDY
The Ugha word for gold translates as
ìtreasure.î But the treasure wasnít *
gold, it was knowledge. Knowledge was *
their treasure. *
Marion walks up to Mutt and touches his face near the wide gash *
that has re-opened down his right cheek. *
MARION
Oh, honey, youíre going to have a nasty *
scar.
MUTT *
I know. *
Indy moves back and leans against a rock, everything hurts *
everywhere. He motions for Marion to join him, she sits next to *
him. They look at each other and embrace. *
 129. 10/17/07
Itís getting dark. *
MUTT (contíd) *
what, weíre just gonna sit here? *
INDY *
Night falls quick in the jungle, kid. *
You donít want to climb down the *
mountain in the dark. *
MUTT *
No, I can. Whoís coming with me? *
He heads down the steps. *
INDY *
Why donít you stick around, Junior? *
Mutt stops, turns and looks at Indy. *
MUTT *
I donít know, why didnít you, Dad? *
Oxley turns and looks at them, sweetly puzzled again. *
OXLEY *
ìDad?î (looking at Indy, then turns and *
looks at Mutt) Dad? *
Indy pushes back his hat and looks up. *
INDY *
Somewhere an old man is laughing.( or - *
somewhere your grandpa is laughing) *

A161 INT CAMPUS BUILDING DAY *
Dean Stanforth, the dean of Indyís college, hurries down a *
corridor in the college building. Heís dressed in his Sunday *
best, seems terribly late for something. *
But he stops for a moment outside the door to an office. A *
PAINTER is standing in front of a certain door, adding to the *
stencilled name on its frosted glass panel. *
On the top line it says îPROFESSOR HENRY JONES JR.î But on the *
line just below it, the Painter is adding two words: *
ASSOCIATE DEAN *
The Painter is just finishing the last N. Stanforth hesitates, *
smiling. The Painter looks over his shoulder, am I doing *
something wrong? *
STANFORTH *
Marvelous, perfect. Make the letters *
bigger, much bigger. *
The Painter returns to his work as Stanforth hurries down the *
hall again, ducking into his own office-- *
B161 INT. STANFORTHíS OFFICE-DAY *
--where he runs in and heads for his desk. Opens the drawer and *
finds a certain book and pulls it out. *
Itís a tattered old Bible, the kind thatís been in a family for *
years. From the Bible in Stanforthís hands, we-- *
161 OMITTED *
*
*
 130A. 10/17/07
162 INT CHAPEL DAY
--cut the same Bible, now held in the hands of a SERIOUS *
MINISTER, standing at the front of an impressive church. *
Indy, dressed in a suit and bow tie, stands before him, and *
Marionís next to him, looking radiant in a simple white suit. *
Muttís just beside Indy, in a sharp suit and tie. *
MINISTER *
Henry Jones, Jr. and Marion Ravenwood, in *
so much as the two of you have agreed to *
live together in Holy Matrimony, have *
promised your love for each other by *
these vows, the joining of your hands *
and the giving of these rings, I now *
declare you to be Husband and Wife. Whom *
God hath joined together, let no one put *
asunder. *
Stanforth sits in the first row, smiling happily, his WIFE beside *
him. Harold Oxley is next to them, washed and brushed up and *
looking fine.
OXLEY
Ahh, ìhow much of human life is lost in
waiting.î
Up front, the Serious Minister drones on. *
MINISTER *
Congratulations, you may kiss your *
bride. *
Marion hands her flowers to the Minister and impulsively hugs *
and kisses Indy. *
The small crowd CLAPS and Oxley leaps to his feet, cheering. *
The couple with Mutt head down to meet the crowd. *
OXLEY
Well done, Henry!
At the sound of their shared name, Indy and Mutt both turn. They
grin and speak at the same time.
INDY
Thanks, Ox!
MUTT
Thanks, Ox!
The Serious Minister wraps it up. *
*
 131. 10/17/07
Mutt moves to one of the pews and grabs his camera, gets ready to *
take a photo. *
The front doors of the church blow open. A breeze rushes in. A *
familiar fedora blows right off its hook and rolls down the *
center aisle, coming to rest at the toes of a pair of scuffed-up *
motorcycle boots. *
Mutt picks up the hat, dusts it off, and looks at it. He
hesitates for a moment, then raises it to his own head, maybe
just to see if it fits, heís got it halfway there but --
-- A HAND reaches in. Indy snatches the hat away from Mutt, gives
him a look, and puts the battered old fedora back, the only place *
it belongs, on his own head.
Indiana Jones holds his arm out for Marion, she takes it, and
they walk out through the open doors that lead to anywhere.
The crowd follows, leaving Mutt standing alone. He takes his *
leather jacket and camera and heads out. *
FADE OUT.
